"Fan, The",Short,2021,"(1996) **** - C:Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio del Toro, Chris Mulkey. I have the feeling that this film will not do well. However, ""The Fan"" has many things going for it to draw in the crowds. It has the greatest actor working today, Robert De Niro. It has Wesley Snipes, who can be a box office draw. It's a suspense film, in the tradition of ""Cape Fear"". And it's about baseball, which appeals to sports fans. It might open strong, but afterwards bad word of mouth is sure to spread quickly. De Niro plays Gil Renard, a knife salesman and baseball fan who is just slightly starting to lose touch with reality. The film starts near baseball's opening day and Gil's hometown team, the San Francisco Giants, have high hopes for their newly acquired hitting sensation Bobby Rayburn (Snipes). Gil, unfortunately, also has huge expectations for the new player. We find out that Gil is slipping at his salesman job, and unless he lands a big account, he is going to be fired. The only chance he has to secure the account would mean that he would miss the opportunity for him and his son to see the opening game of the season. He tries to do both however, and neither situation works out. The events which occur at the ballpark enrage Gil's ex-wife, who gets a restraining order preventing Gil from seeing his son. Also, as a result of him missing his sales appointment, he loses his job. These two events push a man who was already on the edge of sanity, completely over the line. So Gil grasps hold of the only thing he has left: baseball. And more specifically, Bobby Rayburn. Bobby, on the other hand, is having problems of his own. A mild injury he received in the opening game is hampering his game play and he enters a slump. To make matters worse, the Giants' player that he replaced (del Toro) is starting to play very well, making Rayburn look even worse. As a result, the fans immediately turn on Rayburn. Everyone that is except for Gil. In his new, demented state of mind he will do whatever it takes to insure that his favorite player Rayburn has every opportunity to lead his team to victory. Overall, I think that in terms of story and screenplay, the film is not well crafted. First, the previews are wildly misleading. The previews make you think that the movie is about psycho De Niro stalking Snipes for the whole film, when actually that's only the last 30 minutes or so. Second, there really isn't that much going on in the film. I mean, the opening game of the season eats up about 20-25 minutes of the movie, and the events of the game really aren't that crucial. Also, there's absolutely no character to like here. You've got psycho De Niro on one side, and cold, unsympathetic Snipes on the other. So you've got a conflict between two characters that no one will care if either of them comes out on top. Normally, all of these things add up to a bad movie by my standards. But there is one specific thing about the film which I enjoyed tremendously. So much, in fact, that it was enough to give the film such a high rating. De Niro gives such a fun performance that I was entertained to the point that I could overlook all of the negative things about the film. His performance calls to mind, naturally, other roles he's played in the past, probably most specifically Rupert Pupkin from Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"". De Niro is given a great deal to do in the film and he make the most out of every scene he's in. One particular scene in which he chases after a foul ball is one of the funniest moments I've seen on film in a long time. But, only because it's Robert De Niro. I don't think any other actor could have made me enjoy this character like De Niro did. Sure he's just playing a variation on countless other roles he's done in the past. But it's what he does best and it's enough for me. There are a couple of other good things about the film. Tony Scott's direction is excellent, as always. The soundtrack which consists of many Rolling Stones songs and score music from Hans Zimmer helps to move the film along nicely. Also, there's a great ""surprise"" during the final scene which I really enjoyed. So overall, most people probably will dislike the film, but De Niro made it worth my time.

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"(TriStar) Directed by Tony Scott Written by Phoef Sutton, based on the novel by Peter Abrahams Cast Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, John Leguizamo, Ellen Barkin, Benicio Del Toro MPAA Rating ""R"" (presumably for language and violence) Running Time 115 minutes Reviewed at Mission Valley Cinemas, Raleigh, NC (13AUG96) The first hour is exciting. Before his character ever draws blood, Robert De Niro cuts a chilling figure as an edgy knife salesman (!) whose life is increasingly in shambles. He can't make the numbers at work, his ex-wife is threatening him with a restraining order, and, now, his favorite baseball team's expensive new addition (Wesley Snipes) is hitting his first slump. What's a psychotic fan to do? In these expertly shot early scenes, director Tony Scott (CRIMSON TIDE, TOP GUN) generates tension in the most unlikely of places. Who else would film a car-phone conversation like a high- speed chase? About the time that De Niro's character gets down to business, though, the suspense starts seeping away. Major dramatic events happen, but they don't register. Plausibility wanes, tension fades, and, finally, we're left holding the umbrella during one howler of a rain-soaked night game. The finale is so bad-- so jaw-dropping awful-- that even Marge Schott might be at a loss for words.

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"Tony Scott is a gifted director at one thing: making a dull lack luster film look glossy and attractive. Sometimes he does more than just this, an example would be his previous Crimson Tide. With The Fan he has returned to being the director who makes a lack luster film look glossy and attractive. In The Fan Robert DeNiro is an obsessive baseball fan. He is a troubled man with all sorts of problems in his life, he can't see his son, he's on the verge of losing his job, and, well, he's just a little wacky. Wesley Snipes gives a decent Barry Bonds impersonation in The Fan. Snipes is a recently acquired $40 million free agent for the San Francisco Giants from the Atlanta Braves. The Fan moves at a snail's pace for the first hour, and really does not improve after that. The first hour does only one thing, it shows how DeNiro's Gil Renard is a crazed troubled man. After that, the movie picks up pace, following DeNiro and his ""support"" for Snipes' Bobby Rayburn. But, this pick up of pace is not much of a help for the movie. Scott does a wonderful job of filming and making this film look good. But, this is a complete loss because of the putrid script that he is shooting with. All of the characters are presented as cardboard cutouts. And there are even characters that I can't figure to why they are given such a big role, one of those would be Ellen Barkin's Jewel Stern. The baseball scenes are, surprisingly, few. This is good because the baseball scenes do not feel all that authentic, especially the end climatic baseball sequence. Tony Scott needs to be more selective when picking scripts to work with. The Fan is obviously a skeleton worth of a script that needed a whole lot of work before it was shot. Scott needs to find more scripts like Crimson Tide. When he is given a good script to work with, Tony Scott can put out a wonderful film. But, when he is given a bad script to work with, his talents for looks are wasted. Skip The Fan, though Tony Scott has made this lack luster film look glossy and attractive, it's only looks, there's nothing of substance here.

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"I'm sure this seemed like a good movie somewhere along the line. But then sh*t hit THE FAN, turning a surefire success into cliche-ridden thriller crap. Robert DeNiro has played some good crazies in his time, from TAXI DRIVER and the 1991 remake of CAPE FEAR to his star-stalking fan in THE KING OF COMEDY. Now he's the baseball player-stalking fan out to make sure Wesley Snipes gives credit where credit is due. This is all retread territory, from DeNiro as the stalker to Snipes as the baseball player. Or have we forgotten a lame 80's comedy called MAJOR LEAGUE? Watch the commercials for THE FAN and you'll know where it's headed in thirty seconds. But it takes over an hour for the actual movie to go anywhere. No, we have to watch DeNiro DeGenerate from a knife salesman to an unemployed lunatic, and we have to watch Snipes suffer through a severe slump after being signed to a $40 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. There are more unnecessary expository scenes than you can count and we even have to sit through Aaron Neville's rendition of the national anthem on opening day. I wondered for a few minutes why they chose Neville before realizing DeNiro probably demanded they put someone with a bigger mole than him in the movie. Meanwhile, the supporting players worm their way into the movie. John Leguizamo, el mexicano tokeno, plays Snipes' agent and best friend. Ellen Barkin plays the ""ball-busting"" radio reporter who serves no other purpose than to display her new Aniston haircut. She runs the call-in show that DeNiro frequently runs his mouth on. You see, DeNiro is completely obsessed with the game and has a Shrine-O-Snipes in his house. So it's only natural that, after another player (Benicio Del Toro) gets on a winning streak that Snipes attributes to his wearing the number 11 on his uniform, DeNiro sneak into the steam room and stab Del Toro in the leg with one of his company's knives, as a free demonstration of their quality, of course. Up to that point, there's no action whatsoever in THE FAN. And after that point, the movie still doesn't get any better. That's when Snipes starts hitting again but tells DeNiro it's because he stopped caring, the cardinal sin for DeNiro. Not only do you care about the game, you also thank the psychos who kill off your competition, something Snipes apparently never learned in the minors. Now he's got a crazed ex-pitcher on his hands, an ex-pitcher who knows the one thing in the world Snipes cares about is his son. So guess what DeNiro does to the son? Imagine a kid taking a nap and the answer will come to you. There's not a single move in THE FAN that isn't apparent several scenes before it happens. The whole time I was waiting for the movie to catch up to me, but it never did. I was on third base by the time the movie was on first. Not only was it unoriginal and predictable but the cutting-edge tilted camera angles got on my nerves before the first reel was up. That stuff can benefit a movie aesthetically only if it's used sparingly. Film every scene that way and it becomes annoying. Normally you can count on DeNiro and Snipes both to appear in high-quality movies but not even the best all-stars hit home runs all the time. With an average like theirs, though, you can forgive the occasional strike-out, which is exactly what THE FAN is.

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"My my my, what a mess to wade through in writing a review about THE FAN, Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes' hotly awaited new thriller set in the obsession-filled world of baseball. The film is essentially one long study of dysfunction. Knife salesman(!) Gil (De Niro) is divorced, is on the verge of losing his job, doesn't know how to relate to his kid, shouts obscenities at his clients -- your every day run-of-the-mill psycho -- and is *obsessed* with the San Francisco Giants. Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) is a $40 million golden boy outfielder, newly traded to the Giants, and is not earning his keep. He's batting in the .100's, is being upstaged by rival Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro), can't get his traditional number 11 jersey, and has his own family problems. Nonetheless, he's still an egocentric jerk driven by greed, groupies, and fame. When these two cross paths, it can only be trouble -- sure to make you reevaluate the phrase, ""I want you to hit a home run for me."" There's plenty good and plenty bad in THE FAN, and as I've said, trying to figure out where to start is a problem. Directed with Tony Scott's (CRIMSON TIDE) well-crafted style, THE FAN is often a fun and thrilling ride. The most fun to watch are De Niro and Snipes, who turn in very believable performances en route to the film's big finish. But there's this problem that gnaws at the viewer the whole film -- that none of the characters are remotely likable. At all. Not even the supporting characters (Del Toro, John Leguizamo as Snipes's personal manager, Ellen Barkin as a sportscaster) are warm and fuzzy. Instead, everyone falls into the me-first trap that plagues the leads. The result alienates the audience into not really caring who wins this battle of nerves, much to the film's detriment. Combined with sketchily-developed characters, some annoying dialogue, horrible editing that is used to intentionally trick the viewer, some glaring technical gaffes associated with the game of baseball, and a wholly inappropriate soundtrack (which somehow features almost every Rolling Stones song ever recorded), THE FAN is a jumbled mess of good and bad. Thank God it has some fun. Near the climax of THE FAN, Wesley Snipes's character hits a deep fly ball. Everyone in the stadium waits in anticipation to see it clear the fence. The outfielder goes back back *back* -- no soup for you! That pretty much sums up the whole film. -Christopher Null / null@filmcritic.com / Writer-Producer -Visit the Movie Emporium at http://www.filmcritic.com/ -and Null Set Productions at http://www.filmcritic.com/nullset.htm The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"Quick, match the psychotic Robert DeNiro character to the film in which he appears: 1) Travis Bickle...all right, that was a gimme. How about Max Cady? Or Rupert Pupkin? It seems that DeNiro has played an inordinate number of nut cases, but each one has been a distinct creation. It also seems less than coincidental that all of the aforementioned roles -- in TAXI DRIVER, CAPE FEAR and THE KING OF COMEDY, respectively -- were directed by Martin Scorsese. Scorsese knows DeNiro well enough, and has enough talent, to refuse to let him lapse into self-parody. Tony Scott, on both counts, does not. THE FAN is an piece of hack work in which everyone involved flounders in a pointless story made even more intolerable by Scott's oppressive atmospheric theatrics. DeNiro plays Gil Renard, a divorced hunting supplies salesman and life-long San Francisco Giants fan. Gil is particularly excited about the upcoming season, because the Giants have signed reigning league MVP Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) as a free agent to join established team star Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro). Unfortunately, Gil is a bit _too_ devoted to baseball; in fact, he is an unhinged obsessive, and when he loses both his job and visitation rights with his son, he buries himself even deeper in the game. When Rayburn goes into a prolonged slump, Gil begins to feel that there is a connection between them, and decides to take action to help him. That action does end up connecting the two men, a connection which doesn't make Rayburn too thrilled about getting up close and personal with his fans. It saddens me to announce the return of the Tony Scott responsible for DAYS OF THUNDER and BEVERLY HILLS COP II after a brief hiatus during which he channeled brother Ridley to produce the tense and claustrophobic CRIMSON TIDE. This is the Tony Scott who has ingested the Simpson/Bruckheimer visual motif to such an extent that he seems medically dependent on the kind of lighting which makes everyone in the film look like George Hamilton; this is the Tony Scott whom one suspects might never have been able to set up a shot he liked if blinds had not been invented. Scott is a director who generally takes a script, actors and solid production values and grinds them into hamburger to be smothered in slow motion and a spirit-crushing soundtrack. Whatever substance their might have been in the story of THE FAN is rendered toxic by contact with Scott's ""vision."" This is an ugly, ugly film. There is no great challenge involved in figuring out what the psychological underpinnings of this story were supposed to be, and that they might actually have made a decent film in some alternate reality. We are meant to see Gil as a beaten-down Everyman whose desire for a life where he is noticed drives him to an ultimately violent fascination with the celebrity he idolizes, sort of a hybrid of Willie Lohman and Charles Manson. But the sympathetic side of Gil never comes through -- he is frightening and crazy when we meet him, and it is obvious that he has been frightening and crazy for some time from the reactions of his boss and ex-wife. Bobby Rayburn is sane, but screenwriter Phoef Sutton fumbles any development in his character. The arrogant but superstitious superstar has a life which parallels Gil's in ways so obvious that you can feel the elbow in your ribs -- a divorce, a young son, a perfectionist streak driven by their fathers, etc. -- but beyond those bits of trivia there is nothing to him. Wesley Snipes looks leaden most of the time, trying to find some kind of emotional core which just isn't there, and Scott's direction steadfastly refuses to allow him the faintest hope of doing so. Snipes is in trouble from the start with a character who makes no sense, but at least you might hope for some creative lunacy from DeNiro. Sadly, what emerges instead is a performance which slaps together pieces of his superior work for Scorsese. Like Travis Bickle, he is a loner lacking social skills living a kind of double life; like Rupert Pupkin, he uses his idol to get his shot at fame; like Max Cady, he is violent and uses the child of his nemesis to get even. In the twenty years since TAXI DRIVER, everyone who fancies himself an impressionist has done a lazy DeNiro impression by squinting and rasping, ""You talkin' to _me_?"" It's depressing to see DeNiro doing his own impression of himself. THE FAN is the kind of film which makes me angry enough to point out idiotic inconsistencies like overhead shots of Candlestick (now 3-Com) Park which obviously were taken at 49er games, but the fact is that I don't need to. It is a film lacking a single character with whom to identify, without a single shot which doesn't remind you that its director cares more about the filter he has chosen than he does about his characters. That's right, Tony Scott...I'm talkin' to _you_. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"As shown in Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, and Cape Fear, Robert DeNiro has nailed down the psycho stalker bit cold. As if he needed to prove it again, DeNiro plays--rather well, I might add--the titular stalker in the new thriller The Fan. While not quite as inspired as the work of its lead, Tony Scott's film is an entertaining piece of work, if not the most original. Gil Renard's (DeNiro) life is in ruins--he's about to be let go from the sporting knife company is father created, and his wife (Patti D'Arbanville Quinn) won't let him see his son. While everything crashes around him, Gil holds on even more tightly to the one thing that's kept him relatively sane--San Francisco Giants baseball. Ironically, it is also what drives him over the edge, for he becomes obsessed with helping his favorite Giant, highly-paid outfielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), come out of a slump. Despite fine work from the always-great Snipes, Ellen Barkin (as a tough sports radio host), and, surprisingly, John Leguizamo (appropriately oily as Bobby's agent), this is DeNiro's movie all the way. The territory is quite familiar for him, and as such his work can't help but feel somewhat derivative--the geeky, deluded Gil is a variation of The King of Comedy's Rupert Pupkin. But to make him Pupkineque is a wise choice; Gil, while always somewhat on the edge, comes off as a regular guy--passionate about his likes and dislikes, somewhat overconfident at times, but not nearly as cool as he thinks he is. When Gil does finally lose it, DeNiro doesn't chew the scenery; he remains rather calm, an appropriate acting choice that conveys Gil's feeling of justification for his actions--and, in the process, appears more menacing and more human. However, the human angle in the latter part of the film comes exclusively from DeNiro, for Phoef Sutton's script doesn't follow the same line. Sutton effectively humanizes Gil in the film's first half, showing how a borderline personality is finally driven to insanity by the turmoil of outside events. But when he crosses that line, all of that goes out the window. There's no more empathizing with Gil, only fear of what he's become--a murderous psycho. It is to DeNiro's credit, and director Scott's, that Gil manages to come off as more. Sutton does manage to work in a great bit near the end of the film where Bobby asks Gil what he wants from him, and, after a moment of pondering, Gil can't come up with an answer. In that brief moment, Sutton vividly shows the absurdity of the stalker mentality. The biggest problem of The Fan isn't the writing--it's the theatrical trailer, which gives pretty much the whole film away. Director Scott must be commended for making a brisk, stylish film that still manages to create some suspense, even if a number of the plot points were divulged in the trailer. It's not especially scary, but it does entertain, and that's the bottom line. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Fan, The",Short,2021,"Cast: Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, John Leguizamo, Ellen Barkin, Benicio Del Toro, Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn, Andrew J. Ferchland, John Kruk Director: Tony Scott Producer: Wendy Finerman Screenplay: Phoef Sutton based on the novel by Peter Abrahams Cinematography: Dariusz Wolski Music: Hans Zimmer U.S. Distributor: TriStar Pictures Travis Bickle (TAXI DRIVER). Rupert Pupkin (THE KING OF COMEDY). Max Cady (CAPE FEAR). Dwight Hansen (THIS BOY'S LIFE). These are a few of the names from the gallery of psychos essayed by celebrated actor Robert De Niro during his thirty-year career. And, though each of these characters is unique, there exists at least one common element amongst them (other than the obvious) -- they are all three-dimensional creations, individuals who attain a terrifyingly believable life. The credit for this goes to both De Niro and to the writers and directors who sketched the outlines that he so ably filled in. Therefore, given De Niro's track record, it was reasonable to expect good things from him in THE FAN, director Tony Scott's followup to last year's blockbuster, CRIMSON TIDE. In fact, with De Niro playing a sociopathic baseball nut, one might be forgiven mistakenly believing that this movie had potential. Unfortunately, whatever promise the idea held was lost early in the film making process. The version of THE FAN to reach movie screens is as unwatchable a thriller as has come to theaters this year. De Niro, in fact, is part of THE FAN's problem. Mugging it up for the camera, he gives a tasteless, uninteresting, caricature-like portrayal. The actor, who's usually a delight to watch, turns in one of his worst performances as the troubled Gil Renard, a recently fired hunting-knife salesman with an unhealthy passion for Giants baseball. Gil latches onto the Giants' latest free-agent acquisition, superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes, doing a credible Barry Bonds impersonation), who signed a multiyear, $40 million contract to play with the San Francisco team. Gil, whose personal life is a mess (he's divorced and his ex-wife has taken out a restraining order on him), becomes fixated on Bobby, and it doesn't take him long to cross the line from obsessive fan to stalker. After the 1994 strike, one could make the case that baseball no longer deserves anyone's respect, but it's hard to argue that it merits the ghastly treatment handed out by Tony Scott. THE FAN treats everyone associated with the game -- fans, announcers, and players -- with contempt. Not only is the script superficially nasty, but the game sequences are poorly-filmed, with quick edits used to disguise the fact that hardly anyone involved (with the possible exception of ex-Major Leaguer John Kruk) can actually swing the bat. Baseball credibility is thrown out the window, especially during the impossible-to-swallow climactic struggle, which (believe it or not) echoes a similar scene from THE NAKED GUN. Actually, I might have been able to forgive THE FAN its liberties if it had been remotely enjoyable. But it's not -- the film replaces tension and excitement with reel after reel of tedium. The script spends too much time with cardboard characters like Bobby and Gil, while introducing others like sports radio host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin) who serve no purpose whatsoever. The entire first hour is devoted to showing what is immediately obvious: that Gil is a borderline nutcase with a volatile temper and a love of knives. Something must have gotten lost in the translation from book to movie. Phoef Sutton's script is based on a novel by Peter Abrahams, and it has all the characteristics of a hatchet job. THE FAN is disjointed, poorly paced, and, at times, completely incoherent. While Sutton has to bear some of the blame, the lion's share goes to Tony Scott, who has badly mishandled every aspect of this film. The director appears to have backslided into his unpromising BEVERLY HILLS COP II phase. Aside from Snipes' well-tuned performance and a few clever scenes detailing superstar marketing, this picture is a veritable wasteland. Even watching the horror show that the real Giants have become during the 1996 season is more fun than this. The advertising slogan may be ""fear strikes soon"", but, when it comes to THE FAN, fear, like the movie, strikes out. - James Berardinelli e-mail: berardin@bc.cybernex.net ReelViews web site: http://www.cybernex.net/~berardin The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"""Riget""",Documentary,2022,"The story is situated in the Danish National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) a.k.a. The Kingdom (Riget). The site was originally a bleach pond where clothes were damped and laid out in the sun to bleach, causing the moor to be constantly shrouded in fog. Now the Hospital is located were the pond used to be, with all its doctors, scientists and technology, defining life so superstition never again will shake believe in science. But perhaps this arrogance and the consistent denial of the spiritual has been too much. The cold and moisture have returned and the solid and fashionable building has begun to show signs of fatigue. The gate to the Kingdom has begun to reopen. This is how the new thriller from Lars von Trier opens. Originally THE KINGDOM was a television series in four parts, but simultaneously it has now been released as a movie. One of the main characters is mrs. Drusse, a professional patient and clairvoyant, who hears the cry of a little girl ghost in the corridors of the Hospital. Her task is to reveal the plot of the film. Whenever she is discharged, she invents a new disease to be hospitalized so she can explore the mystery. Her contrast is Dr. Helmer, chief surgeon and a stupid bastard who eventually ends up worshipping the occult area, as the Zombie culture is normally regarded. This is one of the characteristics in Lars' movies: to blend scientific research and metaphysics, science and superstition, the exact and the occult. The inspiration from ""Twin Peaks"" is turned from fire into water steaming from the broken pipes in the basement parking lot. The strength in this story is the small anecdotes--for example, the medical student who can't stand the sight of blood, but spend the time on duty in the sleep-laboratory by watching a horrible bloody movie on VCR. There are many references to other pictures, Ridley Scott having provided material to some of the spiritualistic scenes. Eventually the story reaches its climax in the end where the Minister of Health visits the hospital and all the spirits are led loose. The series reached almost cult status in Denmark: while it was running in December, the streets were almost empty when a new episode was shown. Everywhere people were discussing the latest development in the series, more often than to debate the weather. It will be exiting to see the promised sequel, and how the rest of the world will welcome this black-humoured thriller.

"""Riget""",Documentary,2022,"Cast: Ernst-Hugo Jaeregaard, Kirsten Rolffes, Soeren Pilmark, Baard Owe, Ghita Noerby, Birgitte Raabjerg, Jens Okking, Peter Mygind, Otto Brandenburg, Udo Kier Directors: Lars von Trier and Morten Arnfred Producers: Sven Abrahamsen, Philippe Bober, Peter Aalbaek Jensen, Ole Reim, Ib Tardini Screenplay: Lars von Trier, Thomas Gislason, Niels Voersel Cinematography: Eric Kress Music: Joachim Holbek U.S. Distributor: October Films Subtitled Ask Lars von Trier what his favorite line from Shakespeare is and he might respond, ""There's something rotten in the state of Denmark."" At least, that's the impression you'd get from watching THE KINGDOM, von Trier's ambitious project about the strange goings-on inside Copenhagen's National State Hospital (a.k.a. ""The Kingdom""). Originally devised as a 4-part mini-series for Danish television, THE KINGDOM received limited theatrical distribution in the United States courtesy of October Films. Since these are only the first four episodes of a planned thirteen, there are a significant number of loose ends and unresolved plot threads. Although THE KINGDOM has a climax of sorts, it doesn't have a conclusion, and that can be extremely frustrating for anyone who has invested more than four and one-half hours viewing this film. I don't know whether von Trier ever watched David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS, but THE KINGDOM is so like Lynch's outlandish television series that it can't just be a coincidence. Both tales start out with a series of slightly offbeat characters stuck in a seemingly-ordinary situation, then things are gradually twisted until we're watching men and women struggling to cope with a surreal existence where the supernatural reigns. And, as was the case with TWIN PEAKS, THE KINGDOM grows progressively less compelling as circumstances become more removed from reality. If nothing else, von Trier shows a lot of inventiveness in fashioning a watchable story from so many diverse elements. And there is something in THE KINGDOM that keeps you watching, even though it seems to go on forever. Many have described this film as addictive, but, while I disagree with that diagnosis, I sat through the whole thing because I was interested to see how all the subplots would be wrapped up. Ultimately, however, nothing is concluded, and there's no guarantee that if/when von Trier films the rest of the series that those of us outside of Europe will have a chance to see it. Most of the first part of THE KINGDOM is devoted to introducing the large cast of characters. There are three leads: Hyper-egotistical Swedish neurosurgeon Stig Helmer (Ernst-Hugo Jaeregaard), junior doctor Jorgen Hook (Soeren Pilmark), and an elderly hypochondriac, Mrs. Drusse (Kirsten Rolffes), who spends most of the movie chasing the ghosts that are haunting the hospital. When THE KINGDOM begins, Helmer and Hook are at loggerheads, and the situation only worsens as time goes by. Helmer botches the surgery of a child and has his girlfriend, Rigmor (Ghita Noerby), cover up for him. Suspecting malpractice, Hook is out for blood. Meanwhile, after Helmer discharges her, Mrs. Drusse manages to be re-admitted so that she can continue to search for the spirit of a little girl named Mary. Other characters include the flaky chief of staff, Moesgaard (Holger Huul Hansen), who becomes the target of Helmer's ire; an attractive young doctor, Judith (Birgitte Raabjerg), who is pregnant with a fetus that's growing at an alarming rate; a pathologist (Baard Owe) who transplants a diseased liver into himself; a medical student (Peter Mygind) who uses a severed head to woo his true love; and a pair of Down's Syndrome workers who function as a Greek chorus. The best elements of THE KINGDOM are those that drip with acid satire. Von Trier isn't afraid to lampoon anything, from the medical profession to spiritualists and the state of cultural relations between Denmark and Sweden. At times, THE KINGDOM is blisteringly funny. There are scenes when Helmer climbs to the roof of the hospital, gazes longingly at his native country, then calls out the names of famous Swedes like Bjorn Borg before railing at the ""Danish scum"" that surround him. There's also a wonderfully funny bit where various characters try to sneak into the ultra-secure archives to pilfer documents. THE KINGDOM is also a ghost story, but that element doesn't work as well. For the most part, I found the character of Mrs. Drusse to be a tiresome busybody involved in a series of plodding investigations. The more THE KINGDOM turns towards ghosts, zombies, and the supernatural, the less inventive it becomes. This is well-trodden ground, and von Trier isn't adding anything new. One aspect where THE KINGDOM never falters is in its style of presentation. Using tricks that he would later enhance and perfect for BREAKING THE WAVES, von Trier makes an artistic statement through THE KINGDOM's visual appearance. By using a film-to-video-to-film procedure, he gives the movie a washed-out, cinema verite look. Handheld camera shots abound, and there are numerous scenes when some sort of ruddy filter distorts and darkens the film's already muted colors. THE KINGDOM's look may not be polished, but it is interesting. Another aspect that stands out is the high caliber of acting. The strongest portrayal belongs to Ernst-Hugo Jaeregaard, whose stuck-up Helmer is a joy to watch. When he's on screen, Jaeregaard grabs our attention, irrespective of whether his character is sitting at a board meeting, operating, or yelling ""Danish scum!"" into the night air. Although no one else in the cast manages to rise to Jaeregaard's level, the production is blessed with a flock of solid performances. I should note that, stylistic issues aside, THE KINGDOM is very unlike either of von Trier's two internationally-known films, ZENTROPA and BREAKING THE WAVES. Since it was made for television, THE KINGDOM is faster paced than either, and, because of the emphasis on plot, psychological character development is limited. There's no one in THE KINGDOM who rivals the leads of BREAKING THE WAVES for multidimensionality, and the storyline isn't as intense or difficult. Beneath all the strangeness, THE KINGDOM isn't especially deep, proving that length does not necessarily correlate with depth. Since its 1994 release, THE KINGDOM has spawned a cult-like following, which was only to be expected considering its unusual material and style. This is the kind of motion picture that leaves mainstream audiences shaking their heads. Still, as much as I generally enjoy offbeat fare, I found myself strangely dissatisfied with THE KINGDOM. The ultimate payoff doesn't seem to justify the time invested. Von Trier's production has its share of high points, to be sure -- it's just a question of whether there are enough. - James Berardinelli e-mail: berardin@bc.cybernex.net ReelViews web site: http://www.cybernex.net/~berardin The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"""Riget""",Documentary,2022,"This is what would happen if you let David Lynch loose on the set of ""ER"" with nothing but a TV camera, a gaggle of Danish actors, and a bone saw. THE KINGDOM, an extremely ambitious effort for both the filmmakers and the audience, is Denmark's hipper-than-thou answer to ""Twin Peaks."" I'm not even going to attempt to explain the plot of THE KINGDOM, as it could fill several pages and still not make a lick of sense. I'll leave it at this: ""The Kingdom"" is a giant Copenhagen hospital, and every single room in it (and most of the corridors, and the driveway, and the parking lot) contains at least one complete wacko. The dearth of information about this ""film"" belies its true beginnings as a serialized TV show in Denmark. The movie version of THE KINGDOM is nothing more than the first 4 episodes (of a planned 13) from this television show slapped back to back, converted to film, and played in all its grainy glory on the big screen. (Note! This means it's *5 hours* long. Really.) In fact, watching THE KINGDOM is a very TV-like experience. The only things missing are the commercials and a ringing telephone. Of course, I'm not one to watch 5 hours of TV in one sitting. I left after Episode 2, as it's pretty clear where the ""movie"" is going and that there's not going to be a ""big finish"" after Episode 4. This is not to say that THE KINGDOM isn't worth watching. Rather, you *have* to know what you're getting into. Here's some of what you get: a child's ghost living in an elevator shaft, patients holding a seance in their room, bizarre cults of doctors akin to the Masons, an intern who decapitates a corpse to impress his love, a phantom ambulance...and that's just Episode 1. What you don't get is this: much background music, a discernibly strong plotline, a camera in focus, character motivations, or just about anything else you typically expect to find in the world of film. In other words, THE KINGDOM is all but destined to become a phenomenal cult hit. Occasionally, THE KINGDOM overcomes its meandering flaws and completely shocks the audience with some truly powerful scenes. However, most of the time, the movie is just plain weird, and it defies description in any other way. If your butt can handle 5 hours in a movie theater and this sounds like your cup of tea, don't miss it. Otherwise, wait for video...and get the 3-day rental. You'll need it. -Christopher Null / null@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu -Movie Emporium (reviews) / http://www.notes.tpoint.net/emporium/ -Contributing Editor, FEEDBACK / http://www.eden.com/~feedback/ -E-mail requests to join the movie review mailing list The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"_The_Muse_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****) ""I've hit the wall,"" proclaims Albert Brooks's character toward the beginning of _The_Muse_, and one may feel the same about the writer-director-star after seeing his latest, which ends in a most lackluster fashion. But before the film hits that creative obstruction, Brooks is able to get in a number of jabs at Hollywood, and elicits some nice performances from his cast--that is, once he settles into a comfortable comedic rhythm, which he takes his sweet time to establish. That rhythm is established with the arrival of the title character, played--in her neverending quest for respectability--by Sharon Stone, who does fare well in this, her first major comic role. Her mysterious Sarah Little claims to be a bonafide daughter of Zeus, bearing the divine gift of inspiration. Boasting a long and illustrious list of satisfied customers--including James Cameron, Rob Reiner, and, in the film's best comic performance, Martin Scorsese--it takes fairly little to convince jobless veteran screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) to employ her services. Stone obviously has fun sending up her high-maintenance diva image as Sarah, whose gifts come at a steep price; Steven must pay for all of her ridiculous extravagances, such as a deluxe suite at a four-star hotel to late night gourmet snacking food. The laughs arise from these situations are as soft as can be expected, and while there are a few pieces of dialogue where Brooks's famously caustic wit shines through (particularly in Steven's scenes with pompous Hollywood industry types), the film's sense of humor is characterized by a certain gentleness. This makes for pleasantly witty, smile-worthy viewing, but not necessarily gut-busting hilarity, such as the prominent subplot where Sarah inspires Steven's wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) to start up her own business while Steven himself remains bereft of story ideas. And that's what ultimately happens to Brooks and writing collaborator Monica Johnson. Hard answers about Sarah inevitably must come, and when they do, _The_Muse_'s low-fi energy begins to wane. That did not necessarily have to be the case, however, if the explanations propelled the story into a new direction. Instead, though, Brooks and Johnson paint themselves into a corner that they obviously had no idea how to get out of, resorting to a twist ending that is as unsatisfying as it is contrived. Appropriately enough, it seems that Brooks and Johnson needed a muse of their own to really make this film work.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"The Muse is 3/4 of a great film. For the majority of Albert Brooks' newest satire, the comedy is vibrant and funny, the situation is amusing, and the stars are immensely likable. And then, without warning, the film abruptly switches gears into sheer stupidity. I suppose the 80 minutes of running time before it tumbles over into idiocy is worth giving The Muse a (very) minor recommendation. But I just can't help wondering what the film could have been if the formula hadn't derailed in the last dying minutes. To be sure, there are some big laughs and clever moments to be found. Unfortunately, the few crucial twists toward the end leave a sour taste in your mouth. Brooks, directing himself once again, plays screenwriter Steven Phillips. As the movie opens, Steven is receiving a Humanitarian award for his contribution of over 17 Hollywood scripts (one of which was nominated for an Oscar). He ends his speech by stating `I'm the King of the room!', a punch line that no one finds amusing. Steven's co-workers and friends agree, even though the talent is still there, that he has `lost his edge'. This is when good friend and fellow writer Jack (Jeff Bridges) tells him the secret of his success: a muse. As the story goes, they are daughters of Zeus, and are able to inspire creativity. Steven, of course, doesn't believe it at first. So he coaxes Jack into setting up a meeting with his so-called `muse', and he can judge for himself whether she is for real. Sarah (Sharon Stone) is this goddess of creativity. She has worked with such directors as James Cameron, Rob Reiner and Martin Scorcese, and can claim responsibility for The American President and The Truman Show. She requests a room at the Four Seasons hotel, where she is open to unlimited room service, and for a limousine to transport her everywhere she goes. Steven doesn't know quite what to think of this, but figures all this incessant spending is worth it if he is able to regain `his edge'. He laughably attempts to describe the situation to his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell), especially when Sarah calls at midnight requesting a salad and bobby pins to be delivered to her hotel room. Part of the fun in The Muse is seeing what lengths Steven will go to, even if Sarah only claims to be what she is. Is she actually able to inspire her clients, or is she just masterminding an incredible hoax? There is proof of the first query, presented in a nice subplot about Sarah helping Laura to realize her dream of becoming the next `Mrs. Fields' (translation: a masterful cookie queen). And Steven does start to write a screenplay involving Jim Carrey and an aquarium, but he insists that was his idea. Sarah continues to milk him for every penny, Laura begins to enjoy her company and inspiration, and so basically Steven is in hell. Fans of Brooks' low-key humor will likely enjoy his latest effort. There are a couple of great gags - one involving Steven's conversation with a man who can hardly understand the English language - and some nicely placed Hollywood humor. And in the center of it all, there is Sharon Stone's wonderful performance as the snotty title character. Lord knows what Brooks was thinking when he capped off this otherwise engaging comedy with an ending straight out of the Twilight Zone. Up until everything goes awry, I really enjoyed myself. To be fair, I did a large amount of smiling, perhaps... even chuckling. So I was personally pretty bummed out after watching all of these amusing events transpire, only to see them discarded in favor of a hopefully `clever' twist. If I were writing Brooks himself, it would go something like this: `Albert: I quite enjoyed your latest offering. But, WHY??'

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Those damn Muses. The children of Zeus and Mnemosyne are some of the most infuriating of the gods. They are supposed to provide artistic inspiration but they're so demanding and just when you need them, they are busy elsewhere. You sit in front of a glowing computer screen or stand at your easel and there's nothing there. No words. No brushstrokes. You dig deep inside and come up empty. You can't hit the zone that disengages your mind and allows your hands to take on a life of their own. The Muses require a heavy toll. Artists, writers and musicians have varied and often opposing methods of paying tribute: drugs, alcohol, sex, abstinence, solitude, nature, meditation. Many of these are played to the extreme and are often self-destructive, but the Muses demand the artist leave the realm of everyday to receive their messages. Once you get into contact with them, you're on fire. Everything flows. Manuscripts are written, pictures painted, poems composed. You don't even notice hours have passed and the morning birds are singing. The gods are in their universe and all's right with the world. Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks) is a lucky man. He's dealing with Sarah (Sharon Stone), a living breathing real-life Muse who is helping him with his screenwriting slump. Well, maybe he's not so fortunate: Sarah is something of a bitch goddess. Steven is a successful writer. He has 17 screenplays to his credit, one an Oscar nominee. But the day after receiving a Humanitarian award, the studio dumps him. His work has lost its edge. He's past his prime. Desperate for help, he visits his buddy Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) who reluctantly turns him on to Sarah. She has helped him before and is quite the Hollywood deity about town. Steven is overjoyed to work with the Muse until he discovers her requirements. He must bring gifts -- jewelry from Tiffany's. When she gets it, she casually tosses it into a large pile of other boxes in the same pale blue wrapping paper. Homage from other clients. She insists he put her up in a $1,700 a day suite in the Four Seasons. She calls in the middle of the night with a yen for Waldorf Salad. He brings it to her, but she's fallen asleep and doesn't want it anymore. He's willing to put up with all of this because he can write again. When he stalls, she's too busy helping his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) start a cookie business to give him much attention. It gets worse as directors parade to her looking for help. She advises ""Titanic"" director James Cameron not to do a sequel (""Stay away from the water""). Martin Scorsese needs to talk to her about a re-make of ""Raging Bull"" with a thin guy (""Not just a thin guy, but a _really_ thin guy""). Steven can't get any time. Surprisingly, Sharon Stone is the hit of the film. Sarah is a perfect combination of sex goddess and artistic inspiration who arrives at just the right time to save Steven's sanity. Stone has a comedic flare and perfectly captures the flighty irresistible Muse used to having men cater to her every whim. She abuses them and they come back for more because she has what they want. Brooks also directed the film and mostly hits the target. He does miss occasionally and this gives the movie an odd pacing. Just when everything is going fine and the audience is captured, an ill-conceived scene brings it all down. Then he salvages with another hilarious bit. Perhaps he should have hung out with Sarah a bit more. Bridges is outstanding in his small but pivotal role. His natural assumption of the character makes you wish he were around for more screen time. MacDowell is a charmer, but her performance seems flat. The ending is a bit out of left field and undermines the charm of rest of the film. Perhaps because I fell under Sarah's spell, I have to wonder if the gray-bearded doctor is exactly who he says he is. The Greek gods are often tricksters. This isn't a blockbuster and won't pull in the big bucks, but it's an enchanting fairy tale and Sarah is enthralling. (Michael Redman has written this column for 'bout 24 years.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"By Ross Anthony Albert Brooks plays a screenwriter ""passing his prime."" Having ""lost his edge"" he entrusts the inspiration of a mythical muse (Sharon Stone) who's prone to very expensive whimsy. In traditional Albert Brooks style, his character is the sharp-witted, yet droopy eye-browed whiner who just can't believe so many things are going so absurdly off from the norm. He's perfectly amusing anyway. In fact, he delivers a few whammy lines that knocked my socks off. For instance, when wife (Andy MacDowell) rhetorically asks, ""You're not going to walk on the kitchen floor all covered with paint are you?"" Brooks responds, ""I'm not an astronaut, I have to walk on something."" However, apparently due to weak direction and/or quickly shot scenes, a few times Andy MacDowell and even Sharon Stone, look like they're relaxing on the sofa at home reading the script for the first time. I felt embarrassed for them. Though consistently fun in an Albert Brooks kind of way, this film drags its feet with the business of building to a climax. You might find more to muse over if you wait for the video. Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andy MacDowell. Directed by Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Through Get Shorty we learned that to make it in Hollywood, you have to be not of Hollywood. That way all your 'foreign' methods of doing things will be just new enough to work. The west coast was a cakewalk for Chili Palmer and his in your face, loan-shark approach. It's similarly easy for Sarah Little (Sharon Stone), the muse of Albert Brooks' The Muse, not to be confused with Mighty Aphrodite, though the reflective brand of humor in both targets more or less the same audience and both are organized around the continual dilemmas of a neurotic/sardonic male lead and his associations with a mysterious women. Unlike Mighty Aphrodite, however, this is LA, meaning that Lorenzo Lamas is in the diner, Rob Reiner's at the aquarium, James Cameron is at the doorstep, Martin Scorcese's desperately seeking Starbuck's. As in The Player, too, this long string of cameos is just part of the behind-the-scenes- of-Hollywood Hollywood movie, pulling back the curtain on the machinery which makes the magic. What The Muse does to that machine, though, is make it magic as well. Sarah Little claims to be the daughter of Zeus, you see. Which makes her significantly more foreign than Chili Palmer (Olympia vs. Florida). And more than claims: she has all the big-name producers and directors at her beck and call, everyone dependent upon her for inspiration. Enter 'past-his-prime' screenwriter Steven Phillips, (Albert Brooks, same character as always, different name) just let go by a major studio because he's supposedly lost his edge. Edge or no, though, he has a family to support, meaning soon enough he's just desperate enough to believe in earthly deities, divine manifestations, whatever it takes to get his 'edge' back, make him a commodity again. The thing is, though--as he finds out--muses are high-maintenance, requiring ideal conditions to sleep, midnight salads, spontaneous daytrips, limousines etc, all of which harry Steven to the point of exhaustion, strain his marriage in the usual, comical ways, all that. Which is satisfying. To add to the mix he even has an advisor, Jack (Jeff Bridges, not playing Jeff Bridges, which, in a cameo-heavy show, is initially confusing), who's also dependent on Sarah for inspiration. In a movie founded in myth, though, of course the main character will have an advisor. And of course Jeff Bridges pulls it off with grace; his tennis-serving scene is one of the two high-points of it all. The second high point has to be at a cocktail party, when Brooks really lets go with his signature ability to spool dialogue line on top of line, and somehow keep it all at least peripherally pertinent. Every time you think the back and forth is over, it's not, which is definitely his strength. It's why everyone quotes Broadcast News. But The Muse isn't just about underbreath conversation (though it does start slow and hushed, until Sarah gets on-screen). As expected, it's a touch intellectual as well, even going so far as to toy with the foundational myth-structure, or, to foreground what's usually repressed in these divine-intervention mythic cycles: the host/parasite dynamic. The way Sarah is at least as dependent upon Steven as Steven is dependent upon her, which is something of a wry comment upon religion, perhaps, or at least upon a culture always looking over its shoulder to Greece. But quiet enough not to get in the way, too. This is, after all, a movie about the moviemakers, or, the realization of a screenplay about a screenwriter. It has to hold itself to a higher, more self-conscious standard. Is it Skin Deep or Barton Fink, though, right? Well, it has elements of both--even a surprise Coen-ish ending, minus the John Goodman serial killer--but the laugh-a-minute pacing pushes it perhaps a little more in John Ritter's direction, which isn't at all a bad thing.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"For more reviews and movie screensavers, visit http://www.joblo.com/ Actor/writer/director Albert Brooks teams up with several other well-known directors, Scorsese, Cameron, Reiner, as actors, to create a magical film about gorgeous actress Sharon Stone, and cute-as-a-patootie actress Andie MacDowell, spending a night together naked in bed! Well...okay...not exactly, but the point is, it almost happens! Anyway, on to my review... PLOT: A veteran Hollywood screenwriter gets his writing contract terminated when everyone in the industry deems him to have ""lost his edge"". After querying his successful producer friend for help, he suddenly finds himself hooked up with a modern-day ""muse"", who is ready to stir up his creativity...but at a price! You see, the ""muse"" likes to inspire at her own pace, loves extravagance and has a ""thing"" for expensive gifts. CRITIQUE: A very original fantasy tale strung along with plenty of funny lines, a nice pace, a couple of twists and turns, a surprising ending, cameos galore, Hollywood in-jokes, and a spectacular performance from Sharon Stone as ""the muse"". I've given Sharon a hard time over the past few years, with her trying to get all serious and shit, but she is perfect in this role, funny as heck, cute as ever, and man-o-man...what a great ass! :) Albert Brooks is someone whose humor is either appreciated by one or not, much like Woody Allen, and if you haven't liked any of his previous films, you probably won't like this one either. Fortunately for myself, I love Woody Allen, and respect Brooks' unique brand of humor, despite his tepid acting range leaving much to be desired. This film had me laughing out loud for the first thirty minutes or so, but did take a little dip in the second half, with little spurts of humor buoying me afloat. Having said that, the plot itself always kept me interested, while Sharon Stone and her engaging performance, locked me in for good! Don't get me wrong, I also liked Albert Brooks' character, and he certainly hogged all the best one-liners to himself, but Stone stole the show for me. MacDowell, on the other hand, does little but float around in this one, adding very little to the mix, and Jeff Bridges, well, he acts with his tan, and does a mighty fine job at it, if I say so myself! Scorsese's walk-on and a couple of other big scenes have giant laughs, but on the whole, the film is cute, and fluffy, and fun, and well, entertaining. Surely my own bias as a screenwriter might be shining through a little here (Just so you know where I'm coming from :), but Mrs. JoBlo has no interest in the Woods of Holly, and she was also spurting out laughter throughout. Take it as you will, but do appreciate the fact that there are plenty of Hollywood jabs in here, humor which treks heavily through the sardonic, and Sharon Stone is goddamn delicious! Any questions...? And no...I haven't sold any of my scripts either. Anyone know of any cheap muses running around?? Anyone? Bueller? Little Known Facts about this film and its stars: Albert Brooks was born and raised in Los Angeles, Brooks is the son of radio comedian Harry Einstein, known as ""Parkyakarkus"". Brooks' real name is Albert Einstein. His brother is the infamous daredevil ""Super Dave"" Osbourne, whose real name is Bob Einstein. Albert turned down the lead in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... (10/10) because he thought it was too much like a Woody Allen script. Albert himself has been described as a West Coast Woody Allen. Sharon Stone's first (albeit fleeting) film appearance was as the blond goddess glimpsed by Woody Allen on a passing train in Allen's STARDUST MEMORIES. Stone's first major film role was as the conniving young actress girlfriend of Ryan O'Neal in the comedy IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES. She is a member of MENSA, with an IQ of 154. She once auditioned for the Cathy Moriarty role in Martin Scorsese's classic 1980 film RAGING BULL, the Glenn Close role in FATAL ATTRACTION (8/10), the Kim Basinger role in BATMAN (8/10), and the Madonna role in DICK TRACY. She also speaks Italian. Andie MacDowell's full name is Rosalie Anderson MacDowell. In 1988, she became a member of the New York City Church of Christ, a local affiliate with a cult known as the International Churches of Christ. She left the group shortly thereafter, when she was forbidden to take part in the film SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE by the leadership. Jeff Bridges met his wife, Susan in 1975 while filming RANCHO DELUXE. She was working as a maid on a dude ranch, and as of 1999, they're still married. Cameos in this film include directors James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Rob Reiner, actors Lorenzo Lamas, Cybill Shepherd and Jennifer Tilly, and famous restauranteur Wolfgang Puck. THE MUSE marks the sixth collaboration between screenwriter Monica Johnson and Albert Brooks. Their previous films together were MOTHER, LOST IN AMERICA, MODERN ROMANCE, and REAL LIFE (all of which starred and were directed by Brooks) and THE SCOUT (which only starred Brooks).

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com Steven Phillips' career is at a crossroads. Although the script writer for seventeen films (including 1993 Oscar nominee McCormack Place) has just won a humanitarian award, he has been told that he has `lost his edge' by his friend, his agent and his studio  the latter strongly suggesting that he be off Paramount property by 5:00. So Steven does what every other married, white, forty-something male does when they have a mid-life crisis well, actually he doesn't. Most guys would probably have an affair with some high-school-age bimbo, get caught and lose half of their crap. Instead, Steven (Albert Brooks, Mother) turns to friend and fellow Hollywood screenwriter Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges, Arlington Road), who reluctantly admits that his recent success has been due to working with a muse. For those of you that don't remember your Greek mythology, Zeus had nine daughters that were responsible for all creativity. Jack's muse, Sarah (Sharon Stone, The Mighty), a direct descendant of the original nine, has also worked wonders for other Tinseltown dignitaries (male and female) and many make cameos in this film - James Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese and Jennifer Tilly, among others. Jumping at the chance to revitalize his sagging professional life, Steven is thrilled when Sarah tells him that she can begin working with him immediately. Mind you, she doesn't actually write for him or even offer suggestions, but will supposedly make Steven more creative by simply being near him. Sarah also insists on having a suite at the Four Seasons (on a high floor), a limousine, and a fridge stocked with expensive health foods. Initially trying to hide Sarah from his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell, Just the Ticket), Steven eventually comes clean and tells his spouse about the muse. Any other woman might be suspicious of their husband spending so much time with another lady, but Laura believes her husband's honest intentions after witnessing Sarah make Steven fetch her a Waldorf salad and bobby pins in the middle of the night. Not happy with her posh surroundings at the Four Seasons, Sarah firmly requests that she move into the Phillips' Pacific Palisades home, where she works Steven's last nerve and motivates Laura to pursue a career in cookie-making. Oh, yeah  she also helps Steven come up with a great screenplay that he tries to sell to Steven Spielberg. Instead, in a very funny scene, he ends up taking a meeting with Stan Spielberg (comedian Steven Wright), a cousin of the Oscar winner. The Muse is a comical success, with Brooks' dry delivery as potent as ever (he also directed and co-wrote the film with the Oscar-nominated Mother scribe Monica Johnson). My only complaints are that Steven believes in the muse way too easily and that his wife is too quick to believe that he isn't putting the stones to Sarah. But those are very minor objections in a film this entertaining.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Directed by Albert Brooks. Cast: Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Jeff Bridges, Mark Feuerstein, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Reiner. 1999 - 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for mild profanity and brief, partial nudity). Reviewed August 28, 1999. Writer-director Albert Brooks continuously makes sharp, meticulously-written comedies, and that he has refused to reform over the years to ""potty"" humor in the vein of Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler is a commendable decision. Brooks can't win 'em all, though, as proven by his latest picture, ""The Muse,"" a Hollywood satire, which lacks the warmth and human interest of 1996's ""Mother,"" the zany entertainment of 1985's ""Lost in America,"" and the whimsical aspect of 1991's ""Defending Your Life."" Sloppy and superficial, ""The Muse"" has some sizable laughs in its 97-minute running time, but midway through it veers off-course and becomes repetitive, with a final twist at the end that is completely unjustified and a strong sign of last-minute reshooting and tinkering. If the last ten minutes are the way Brooks originally wrote and envisioned them, then my question to him is: ""What were you thinking?!"" 50-year-old high-profile screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks) is at the end of his ropes. A past nominee of an Academy Award, right after winning the Humanitarian Award for his career he is told by a harsh studio executive (Mark Feuerstein) that his past couple scripts weren't very good, and that he has ""lost his edge."" Talking with his friend, Jack (Jeff Bridges), a thriving fellow screenwriter, Steven is told about his secret for keeping successful: he has a muse, supposedly one of the actual daughters of Zeus, whose job is to inspire the customers she takes on. Jack convinces the muse to take on Steven as her next major client, and before they even meet, Steven is instructed to bring her a gift from Tiffany's wrapped in a blue box. The muse in question happens to be Sarah (Sharon Stone), a greedy, pampered woman who nonetheless is likable in her absolute straightforwardness, and who really does begin to inspire Steven concerning his next script, a comedy to star Jim Carrey set in an aquarium. When he is caught by his concerned wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell), buying a present at Tiffany's and shopping for groceries (including Tampons), she is reasonably apprehensive when he says he has a muse, but before long, she and Sarah have met and immediately hit it off, with Sarah even convincing Laura to go into business as a cookie baker. And by the time Sarah has moved into his home and taken over his bedroom, Steven finds his life ultimately being overrun, and starts to question if Sarah should stick around for much longer. ""The Muse"" would have made a fast, enjoyably smart 45-minute short film, but at over twice that length, its story is so thin that the film begins to go through the worn-out, repeated motions, until it reaches the point of no return in the last few scenes, which become too contrived to be believed for a second. It's as if the movie was written and directed by Brooks, but through the post-production process, an evil editor with dastly designs for Brooks decided to cut off his ending and replace it with something so ludicrous and messy that it would destroy his film as a whole and leave a bad taste in every audience member's mouth. For awhile, the film really works well. The satiric moments about Hollywood are winning and sometimes hilarious, as when Steven goes to Universal Studios to have a meeting with a guy named Spielberg, but is only allowed into the lot if he walks. ""That's like nine miles from here!"" Steven remarks to the security man at the front gate. ""Yeah, it is pretty far,"" he replies. A cameo by actress Jennifer Tilly (playing herself) is also very funny, with a sly one-liner concerning her last film, ""Bride of Chucky."" And it was amusing to see such filmmakers as Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, and James Cameron make walk-ons and make ""all-in-good-fun"" jabs at themselves. These jokes, of course, would work better if you know a lot about film and Hollywood, in general, because if you aren't sure what Cameron or Scorsese look like (or, saddeningly, if you've never even heard of them), their scenes will go straight over your head. On the basis of similar movies that make fun of the same subject matter, ""The Muse"" at least works better than the decade's worst major motion picture, the laughless, inane 1998 stinker, ""Burn Hollywood Burn: An Alan Smithee Film."" The highlight of ""The Muse"" is easily Sharon Stone's winning, spunky performance, who hasn't really ever appeared in a big comedy before. Her comic talents have been proven somewhat with 1984's ""Irreconcilable Differences"" and 1999's ""Gloria,"" but it is here that Stone goes all out and runs with her showy role, which is possibly an Oscar-caliber effort. As Sarah, Stone mostly remains a figure throughout, rather than a three-dimensional creation, but this is important since the motives of the character are supposed to remain mysterious. With perfect comic timing and a stunning presence, this is Stone's strongest turn since 1995's ""Casino."" Albert Brooks, as usual, plays the same type of character he always plays, a neurotic, insecure man that spits out clever one-liners like they're going out of style. He was more likable, however, in his last film, ""Mother."" Andie MacDowell is fine as Brooks' wife, Laura, but tellingly, is not given much to do, and her relastionship with Steven is never satisfactorily portrayed or written. At least she does something, which isn't the case with Jeff Bridges, so much better in July's ""Arlington Road,"" who is criminally wasted in the role of Steven's best friend. Bridges shows up every once in awhile, recites a few ho-hum lines, and makes his exit without much of a chance to make any sort of impression. The clear potential that ""The Muse"" possesses only makes the final product even more of a disappointment. As with his character of Steven, Brooks has finally run out of steam in his screenplay for this film, and the ending, which doesn't really solve or wrap up anything, leaves you questioning what the whole point was. Some jokes work wonders, other fall flat (Bridges' tennis scene comes to mind), and all the while it is Stone who walks aways unscathed. That final twist that the film concludes on, though--it is an outrage, and it is a cheat. - Copyright 1999 by Dustin Putman.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"A few days ago screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks), the winner of a humanitarian award for his life's work, was on top of the world. Now, a studio executive -- who proudly owns the sofa used in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN -- tells him that he's lost his edge and should be changing careers. THE MUSE, directed by Brooks and written by Brooks and Monica Johnson, plays like an in-joke to Brooks himself, since he clearly seems to have lost some of his edge in crafting it. A writer and comic who's the best when he's the nastiest, Brooks creates for himself a character that's way too accommodating and sweet. At its high points, as in its numerous cameos, the movie can be quite funny. Between these islands of laughter, however, lie too many deserts of blandness. Steven falls back on the custom of turning to someone famous when you need a favor. Since he met Steven Spielberg two decades ago, he tries to set up another meeting with him. After an incredible ordeal, he finally gets a 5-minute audience with Spielberg. His time alone with cinematic royalty doesn't turn out to be quite what he expected. He talks with Steven Spielberg's cousin Stan (Steven Wright), who doesn't do anything other than offer advice about future movies. ""Just remember, make it in color,"" Stan says. ""People like color."" In order to rejuvenate his creative juices, Steven decides he is willing to try anything including a crazy idea from his Oscar-winning friend Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges). Jack suggests Steven give his muse (Sarah) a try. Unless you've hired one before, you probably have no concept of the enormous cost involved in hiring a muse. Sharon Stone, who normally takes herself way too seriously, plays Sarah with uncharacteristic, child-like playfulness. A world-class spendthrift, Sarah demands a $1,700 a day suite at the Four Seasons Hotel and a refrigerator stocked with special food. She also expects Steven to be constantly at her beck and call as her personal gofer. Sarah doesn't tell her clients what to do. She just inspires them. Her resume includes being the uncredited creative force behind THE TRUMAN SHOW and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT. For Steven, she assists him in coming up with a killer idea for a great summer comedy. He proposes having Jim Carrey inherit a troubled aquarium in which the fish die. After Sarah bonds with Steven's wife, Laura, she starts helping the wife and ignoring the husband. As a would-be Mrs. Fields, Laura is played in an awkward and wooden performance by Andie MacDowell. In a movie that needs more drive, MacDowell functions as the production's black hole, sucking the energy out whenever she appears. Hollywood's brightest stars drop by to get Sarah's advice or to pay her tribute for past suggestions. We learn that it was because of her that Wolfgang Pung took only 30 seconds to decide it would be goat cheese, and not mozzarella, on his famous pizzas. James Cameron comes knocking at her door wanting advice. ""I just don't see you going back to water anytime soon,"" she counsels him briefly before sending him on his way. Martin Scorsese has less luck when he comes by seeking her thoughts on his remake of RAGING BULL using a really thin guy. A caffeine-stoked up Scorsese bounces away when she turns out not to be there at the time. Where is a muse when you need one? Let's hope Albert Brooks locates one before his next film. He's a national treasure who deserves all the muses he needs. THE MUSE runs 1:37. It is rated PG-13 for brief nudity. It would be fine for kids 9 and up, but they would probably need to be teenagers to enjoy it.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"The cinema of the 1990's will be remembered for two things: Quentin Tarantino's revolutionary ""Pulp Fiction"" and its slew of rip-offs, and the spate of films about filmmaking. It is no surprise that since ""The Player,"" we have become bombarded by several films about making films in many different avenues. We have seen low-budget independent filmmakers (Living in Oblivion), fillmaking-on-the-fringes (My Life's In Turnaround), bad low-budget filmmakers (Ed Wood), porno filmmaking (Boogie Nights), Hollywood filmmaking (The Player), mob-financed filmmaking (Get Shorty), low-level Hollywood filmmaking (Bowfinger), and so on. I greeted Albert Brooks' latest film, ""The Muse,"" with delight because of its stellar cast and because of the cynical edge of Brooks. I am happy to report that ""The Muse"" is among his funniest, lightest works, always tinging with delectable wit from start to finish. Albert Brooks stars as Steven Philips, a comedy screenwriter desperate to sell his latest script after winning a humanitarian award (""It's an award you win when you don't win an Oscar.""). The next day, he is anxious and meets with a stiff, humorless studio exceutive, Josh Martin (Mark Feuerstein), and is told none too subtly he's out of a job. ""You've lost your edge. Take a vacation,"" says Martin. Steven is torn since writing for films is his life, and realizes his office will be occupied by Brian De Palma. He tries to get an idea that could reestablish him in the realm of Hollywood, as well as continuing to support his wife (Andie McDowell), an ambitious baker, and his two kids. Steven finds a surprise in the form of a woman in glittery blue dresses named Sara (Sharon Stone) - she is introduced by Steve's friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), a writer. Sarah turns out be the resident Muse of La-La Land - ""I...inspire!"" declares Sara. Steven is faced with a barrage of responsibilities to keep Sara as his Muse. He has to rent a luxurious room at the Four Seasons Hotel for her, provide round-the-clock food and car service for her immediate needs such as a ""Waldorf salad,"" and he must always bring a boxed trinket from Tiffany's to her. And this is all for her to provide inspiration for the struggling writer. I question a comedy writer coming up with a half-baked idea like an aquarium run by Jim Carrey, but that is of little consequence. ""The Muse"" coasts along Brooks's typically cynical, neurotic edge, Sharon Stone's comic sparkle, and the relentless number of inside jokes that will tickle people from Hollywood and movie trivia buffs. There are humorous cameos by film luminaries such as James Cameron, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, Jennifer Tilly, Cybill Sheperd, Lorenzo Lamas, and several others. I enjoyed Scorsese's frenetic moment when he announces he's making a remake of ""Raging Bull"" with a thin, angry guy. Jennifer Tilly's bit is especially cute when Brooks refers to her as a ""doll like Chucky."" Tilly was of course in ""Bride of Chucky."" The biggest, most sensational surprise is Sharon Stone, who I always believed had a gift for comedy but was never allowed to utilize it. Outside of her small comic parts in ""He Said, She Said"" and ""Diary of a Hitman,"" this marks the first time she is allowed to sparkle in a bigger supporting role based her ability to deliver a bouncy charm. She sports a hairdo with bobbypins, wears long blue ""New Wave""-style flowing dresses, and makes do like a spoiled brat who needs to be pampered. Of course, this Muse is not all she's cracked up to be. Brooks has great fun lampooning Hollywood and its obsessive nature towards making big bucks on big ideas. The difference is that in an era where gross humor of the ""Austin Powers"" variety reigns supreme, audiences are not likely to be susceptible to Brooks's low-key charm and natural evolution of character progression, or in this case, aggression. He takes his time, and still has not learned how to end a film with a major bang. Here it ends all too abruptly, as it did in ""Real Life,"" Brooks's first film. But that is a minor carp. I am still not clear of Brooks's point - a muse inspires a writer to choose the muse within him or herself? Can't he seek that same inspiration from his close friends or family? Unless we are led to believe that writers don't have friends in Hollywood when they are considered washed-up and edgeless. Despite a few flaws, ""The Muse"" is amusing and has some showstopping laughs and one-liners along the way. Brooks is a master builder of comic setup and payoff - he knows that the art of comedy is allowing the audience to experience the buildup before the punchline, and boy, the punchlines are smartly written and pungent. Too many comedies rely on gross humor and repetitive gags left and right with no rhyme or reason. Not Brooks, and he has not lost his edge.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"http://www.speakers-podium.com/susangranger. Sharon Stone is an irresistible comedienne in Albert Brooks' slightly surreal send-up of the motion picture business. Taking a whiny cue from Woody Allen, Brooks plays a skewed version of himself - a neurotic middle-aged screenwriter, comparing his job with ""a eunuch at an orgy - except that the eunuch can, at least, watch, while the screenwriter is not even allowed on the set."" When he receives a Humanitarian Award, he facetiously describes a ""humanitarian"" to his daughter as ""someone who has never won an Oscar."" But when he's fired by a weaselly studio exec who claims he's ""lost his edge,"" even his agent agrees. Desperate to save his career, he consults his successful buddy (Jeff Bridges) who admits he owes everything to a Muse - that's Sharon Stone. As a daughter of Zeus, she gets people in touch with their creativity. But she's a pampered muse - demanding a suite at the Four Seasons Hotel ($10,000 a week), limo, and dutiful attendance to her desires. Frantically, Brooks tries to satisfy her capricious whims - as does his wife, earnestly played by Andie MacDowell, whom the Muse encourages to pursue her cookie dream of being the next Mrs. Fields. And it's funny as Martin Scorese, James Cameron, Rob Reiner, and Wolfgang Puck pay Tiffany tributes to the divine diva. Albert Brooks (""Mother,"" ""Defending Your Life,"" ""Lost in America"") is an acute and adept observer of the nutty, ruthless Hollywood scene, skewering its self-absorption and gullibility, but his ironic concept fizzles out as he misses some screwball opportunities with the Muse's legendary use of the magical power of sex - and his riff on Steven Spielberg falls flat. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""The Muse"" is a droll, satiric 7. It's wryly amusing, pointing out that people are who you think they are.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Albert Brooks has always been a filmmaker who couldn't resist a great high concept. In his debut feature REAL LIFE, he parodied the pioneering PBS documentary ""An American Family;"" in LOST IN AMERICA, he sent a yuppie couple on an ill-fated attempt to drop out of society; in DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, he imagined the afterlife as a spiritual courtroom; and in MOTHER, he moved back in with Mom to figure out his relationship troubles. An inspired, outrageous situation has provided Brooks with the spark to show his characters -- notably himself -- coming to terms with themselves and finding a little dignity. His concepts fueled the gags, but he never forgot to tell a story. In THE MUSE, Brooks makes a mistake he's never made before: he starts with a situation comedy, then never moves beyond the situation. Brooks stars as Stephen Phillips, a successful Hollywood screenwriter at a career crossroads. Dumped from a studio deal for writing scripts with no ""edge,"" a depressed Stephen seeks counsel from his friend and fellow writer Jack (Jeff Bridges). Jack offers Stephen access to what he claims is the secret of his own success: an actual, straight-out-of-mythology muse named Sarah (Sharon Stone). Though initially incredulous, Stephen finds that his collaborations with Sarah are firing his creative juices. Unfortunately, he also finds Sarah's services much in demand, including from his own wife Laura (Andie MacDowell), who finds herself inspired to pursue her own creative dreams. THE MUSE seems to have been born as yet another Hollywood satire, poking fun at the insecurities of movie folk and ther fascination with the latest insta-cure for what ails them personally or professionally. Brooks, uses the opportunity to toss in cameos by other filmmakers who have been Sarah's ""clients"" (James Cameron thanks her for TITANIC; Martin Scorsese proposes a remake of RAGING BULL, ""but with a really thin guy""), which are good for a couple of smiles. The insider gags, unfortunately, are about the only ones that work. More often, THE MUSE is a comedy in search of something, _anything_ funny to say. Sharon Stone's finicky diva is an idea that never quite takes off, and the supporting players often look vaguely bored with their lines. Even Brooks' usually reliable persona can't jump-start the film, because it doesn't turn into a sympathetic character. He's just an annoyed privileged guy whose annoyance at his slightly lessened privilege makes him just plain annoying. Brooks' lack of a character is part of the over-riding problem with THE MUSE: a lack of anything substantial past the thin premise. The film occasionally looks like it could be leading Stephen towards a little growing up, whether about his career neuroses or his retro-breadwinner agitation at Laura's growing financial success as a cookie-maker. There's even the faint hope that Brooks could be offering a light-hearted look at the shove people require just to believe in their own talents. Then the film ends, and it becomes evident that there's not a shred of actual story to THE MUSE. There's no improved mutual understanding in the Phillips' relationship, no one grows, no one learns a thing -- there's not even the satisfaction of Sarah explaining her own turns of character. The whole thing just fades to black, leaving a shallow collection of industry jokes in its wake. There are a few decent laughs to be found in Brooks' validation of William Goldman's line about how ""nobody knows anything"" in Hollywood. Mark Feuerstein has a nicely understated role as a tactless studio executive, and Steven Wright appears briefly as the nepotistically- advantaged Stan Spielberg. But much of the acidic humor leaves a sour aftertaste once it's clear that it's all little more than a chance for Brooks to vent. His character spends much of the film in search of a third act for his screenplay, which is ironic when you consider that THE MUSE is in desperate need of a third act of its own. It's even more ironic that in the middle of a Hollywood satire, the protagonist's brilliant script -- the one he's inspired to write after being told he has ""lost [his] edge"" -- is a wacky high-concept vehicle for Jim Carrey. If the lesson Brooks wants us to learn is that a writer's goal in life should be coming up with yet another mass-market yuk-fest, then maybe he's the one who has lost his edge.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Starring: Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Jeff Bridges, etc. According to the dictionary, a Muse is one of nine nymphs generally represented as young, beautiful, and modest virgins, distinguished as the peculiar protectresses of the fine and liberal arts. There is another definition: A loophole; a means of escape. I'm not sure which definition applies here. This is certainly an Albert Brooks film. He stars in it. He directed it. And, he wrote it with Monica Johnson. I'm surprised that he didn't try to portray the Muse, as well. Luckily, he didn't because Sharon Stone gives a delightful performance as the title character. Is Sarah really a Muse? Is she a lunatic who imagines she is a Muse? Is she a con artist pretending to be a Muse? To Steven Phillips (Brooks) and all the other `blocked' writers who cross her path, is she a gift or an albatross? I got the feeling that Jeff Bridges, as writer Jack Warrick, was `palming' her off to his pal, Steven, so that he could get out from under the expense of satisfying her costly and unrealistic demands. Bridges (and his character) deserved much more screen time. Steven's wife, Laura, (McDowell) is justifiably amazed that her husband can be so gullible and is unbelievably tolerant of his behavior. However, the bedroom scene between the two women is one of the funniest of the movie. The numerous cameos throughout the film were wonderful but they lost their impact when they were showed over and over in the television previews. Although the rating is PG-13, it's not a movie for youngsters, because they wouldn't enjoy it, not even with the brief nude scene that gives it that rating. I probably won't even watch it again when it gets to television. I'm being generous giving it a C.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"I love L.A. Despite the traffic, L.A. is the best place to live if you're looking for a casual lifestyle. Los Angeles has been a major player in films from ""Chinatown"" to ""Short Cuts"", perhaps because all the major players in film reside there; the city translated as ""city of angels""(how ironic; I guess all they all moved away). An overlooked aspect of Albert Brooks' terrific comedy ""The Muse"" will be the way Brooks' presents L.A., as a paradise-like city where you could sit home during the day, write a bit of your new action screenplay, and make enough so that your family could live in a Palisades estate. ""The Muse"" is Woody Allen territory, both in the way the film business is presented and in the slightly supernatural mystical storyline. However, what ""The Muse"" will gain its notoriety for is for being Sharon Stone's return to comedy(her last one was ""Irrenconcilable Differences"", her first major film role) after years of forgettable dramatic performances(""Casino"" being an exception). Although her role as the title character won't recieve an Oscar, her natural charm shines through and she is surprisingly likable. ""The Muse"" is the story of Steven Phillips(Albert Brooks), an Oscar-nominated screenwriter who is told by his boss that he has lost his edge. He is subsequently fired and turns to his more successful friend(Jeff Bridges) for he advice. He tells him about Sarah(Sharon Stone), who is a real Muse, the daughter of Zeus, who can inspire creativity. Steven decides to give this Muse thing a try, when he realizes that the Muse has absolutely no concept of money. Sarah will inspire you, but in return you must give her everything she wants. So Sarah ends up moving in to Steven's home, and as well as subtly inspiring Steven, she inspires Steven's wife(Andie MacDowell) into becoming the next ""Mrs. Fields"". A lot of the fun in ""The Muse"" comes from watching different celebrities admit to using the Muse. Rob Reiner thanks her for ""The American President"", James Cameron thanks her for ""Titanic"", Martin Scorsese thanks her for inspiring his remake of ""Raging Bull""(hopefully a joke), and Sarah claims that she did ""The Truman Show"". The only real flaw in ""The Muse"" is a slightly unsatisfying ending which doesn't live up to the comic genius which preceeded it. But Albert Brooks has created a very funny comedy that entertains at Hollywood's expense. What could be better? ""The Muse"" also proves that real inspiration can only be found within yourself, which is something that writers of all kinds need to learn. I, myself, have started work on a few screenplays, only to give up after 5 or so pages. Creativity is certainly not an easy trait. Well, at least Albert Brooks is in top form, proving that he won't be needing a muse for a very long time.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"In his new film Albert Brooks plays a screenwriter who can still write funny material but is losing his ""edge."" He does not know what it means to be losing his edge, but he is losing it nonetheless. Sadly, the script of THE MUSE itself is often very funny, but Brooks seems to be losing his own edge. The Albert Brooks edge was to be able to write dialog that is both funny and true. In LOST IN AMERICA when his wife gambles away ""the nest egg,"" part of the punishment that Brooks thinks of on the spur of the moment is she is no longer allowed to use the words ""nest"" or ""egg."" She must order fried THINGS for breakfast. If she sees a bird's home she must call it a round STICK. This is very funny material because it is so ridiculous and at the same time so possible. But that very real sort of humor is missing from THE MUSE. In this film that kind of dialog is lost in all the sarcasm. Stephen Phillips (Albert Brooks) is a Hollywood screenwriter who may be just getting to be past his prime. When his latest script is rejected he starts worrying about how to feed his family. He goes to his friend, the fabulously successful screenwriter Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges). But who is this beautiful woman kissing Jack good-bye? It isn't his wife. This is a side of Jack that Stephen has not seen before. Eventually Jack admits reluctantly that this woman is not his mistress but really his muse. Literally she is a muse. She is one of the nine daughters of Zeus. If you treat her like a queen she will inspire you to your most creative ideas and your best work. Stephen decides that he has nothing to lose and decides to make her his muse. Her name is Sarah. Stephen starts seeing the Sarah (Sharon Stone) and taking up the responsibility of keeping her happy. Things that appeal to her tastes do not come cheaply. It costs tens of thousands of dollars a week to keep her in the style to which she expects to live. But she apparently is the real thing and Stephen starts getting story ideas that may all be worth the effort of keeping the pampered, spoiled, conscienceless brat happy at all hours of the night with expensive snacks. He will indulge her even if it wrecks his marriage. And it nearly does as his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) foolishly jumps to the conclusion her husband is having an affair and then (surprise!) she very cleverly realizes that explanation does not explain the strange behavior. Again the film parallel its own story when Stephen complains that his new screenplay is lacking a third act and then he chooses one that seems tacked on. The ending is clearly the weakest part of the film. Brooks ties things up, but not in at all a satisfying way. Sharon Stone clearly is enjoying herself behaving pampered and spoiled the way most people secretly would like to be. Brooks is his usual irritable character, but he has played this character too often before. He has also arranged an impressive lineup of familiar film personalities to flesh out his story. What is unfortunate about THE MUSE is that Brooks walked right by the best use of his concept and he never even noticed it. The real story is not the Muse's relationship with Stephen Phillips. The story to tell is how does a Muse establish herself in a cynical town like Hollywood. How does she make her first conquests? How is her reputation established? This may be a story more in the realm of Thorne Smith, but it is certainly where the interesting ideas are. THE MUSE is rated PG-13 for language and a moment of totally pointless gratuitous nudity that apparently is present only to avoid a PG rating. Speaking of rating, I give THE MUSE a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

First, forget the blurbs from quote whores proclaiming the film ""hilarious"" and ""a laugh riot."" It isn't. ""Amusing,"" ""pleasant"" and ""generally enjoyable"" would be more appropriate terms. Second, lower your expectations. Because comedian-writer-actor-director Albert Brooks (""Lost in America,"" ""Defending Your Life,"" ""Mother"") is held in such high regard, people tend to forget that while even the slightest of his films contains moments of comic genius, there are always numerous dead spots as well, even in the best of his works. And ""The Muse"" is not Albert Brooks at his best. Directed and co-written by Brooks, this shaggy dog story is more low-key than his usual offerings, with many flat stretches. Still, there are rewards here, notably jabs at Hollywood mentality; well-placed cameos from Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Wolfgang Puck and others; Sharon Stone's fizzy performance in the title role; and, as always, the satisfaction of watching Brooks do wonderfully slow burns as his exasperation grows, building inevitably to deliciously juvenile outbursts. This time around, Albert plays Steven Phillips, a screenwriter with 17 scripts and an Oscar nomination to his credit. After receiving a humanitarian award at a gala dinner, with his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) and young daughters watching in pride, he goes into the studio the next morning, only to have his world crash around him. A smarmy junior executive casually informs Steven that he has lost his edge. Not only is the studio rejecting his current script, it has decided to release him from his three-picture deal. In a panic, Steven races to the home of friend and fellow writer Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) for counsel. Moved by Steven's desperation, Jack confides the secret of his success. He is a client of Sarah (Sharon Stone), a genuine, daughter-of-Zeus Muse. Muses inspire creativity and Sarah is a hot commodity in the film community. After considerable badgering, Jack finally sets up a meeting between Steven and Sarah. In short order, Steven has his own Muse who lives up to her billing, but provides nonstop headaches along with inspiration. The concept is solid enough, but the execution falters. After a juicy opening, the story meanders and the aimless feel is enervating. The witty vignettes that pop up every few minutes are welcome, but they also underline the weakness of the main plotline. Part of the problem is Brooks himself. The comic actor always plays self- absorbed, self-pitying types (his film persona is essentially the West Coast equivalent of Woody Allen, minus the creepiness), but his Steven Phillips appears haggard and speaks in pessimistic terms even when things are going well. While Brooks' zeal seems muted, he still delivers a number of sharp one- liners, particularly during his temper tantrums. Albert is a master at reacting to annoying characters, and he gets some world-class irritants here. He has some terrific exchanges with an oily Paramount exec (Mark Feuerstein) and a European partygoer (Mario Opinato) who twists the English language like a Bavarian pretzel. There is a lot of old-fashioned shtick in ""The Muse,"" as celebrities pop up for cameos tweaking their own images. ""Titanic"" director James Cameron has a cute bit and Martin Scorsese is a riot, babbling like a hyperactive loon about his insane concept for a ""Raging Bull"" remake. Comic vignettes aside, it's the women who keep the film going. Andie MacDowell gives one of her most likable performances to date as Laura Phillips, who starts realizing her own potential while spending time with the Muse. As Sarah the Muse, Sharon Stone proves quite adept at comedy, deftly creating a character who is at once demanding and ditzy. Stone is clearly having the time of her life playing such an off-beat type, and her enthusiasm is most appreciated. If only the film had as much energy as Stone. It starts off strong and has a clever ending, but oh, does the midsection ever sag. Were I a Muse, I'd have strongly suggested that Brooks and his longtime writing partner Monica Johnson do another draft or two, because even the languidly paced ""Mother"" looks perky compared to this. After watching ""The Muse,"" I'm reminded of the scene in which Steven is told that, while his script is serviceable, it lacks edge. That is exactly the trouble with this movie. ""The Muse"" is amusing, pleasant and generally enjoyable, which would be enough for most filmmakers, but from someone of Albert Brooks' caliber, we have a right to expect more.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"MUSE, THE (director/writer:Albert Brooks; screenwriter:MonicaJohnson; cinematographer: Thomas Ackerman; cast: Albert Brooks (Steven Phillips), Sharon Stone (Sarah, the muse), Andie MacDowell (Laura Phillips), Jeff Bridges ( Jack Warrick), Catherine MacNeil (Anne), Mark Feuerstein (Josh Martin), Bradley Whitford (Hal), 1999) An uninspiring film about a muse (Sharon Stone) in Hollywood helping a writer (Albert Brooks ) who was stuck without a good idea for a script. This is a dull, unfunny film, lacking an edge to it, as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch. Albert Brooks' (Modern Romance, Defending Your Life, Mother) latest film deals with his critique of Hollywood's taste, as it results in Brooks turning out the same kind of film he is railing against. This sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on TV; it should have come with canned laughter. In the theater I saw it, no one laughed; and, watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling. The film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire. Even if the story never took off, I at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the Hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the Hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore. I thought Brooks mailed this script in. All the cameo performances-Rob Reiner, Cybill Shepherd, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, Wolfgang Puck, and Jennifer Tilly- were for no avail, they added nothing to the story. It was hard to think of Brooks as a victim of Hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier. He never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic, only for some ""summer script"" he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie. If he was trying for a parody (which I assume he was), he just didn't succeed. All he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the ""fat cats"" who make up the Hollywood scene, too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it. The affluent Hollywood milieu of the film took away any chance but for us to see him fit right into the upscale lifestyle of those who frequent the tennis courts, swimming pools, and live in those mansions with guest houses. But I think the main problem with the film, besides the fact that it's a one idea film, is how that idea was weak and never developed.The Brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was. It was difficult to see what was his problem, especially when he has a lovely wife (Andie MacDowell) whom he loves and two sweet daughters, a splendid home, drives a Mercedes, is an established Hollywood writer after 17 years in the business, has good contacts there, and is rich. I feel I must question the film's intent: Why should I feel sorry for Brooks? What is this edge that he is supposed to have lost? Where is the comedy in the film? What is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean? What kind of statement is he making about creativity? Should I really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired? Is he trying to tell me that people in Hollywood will believe in anything and so should I? The Muse opens with Brooks winning a Humanitarian Award. His daughter asks him, ""what is a humanitarian?"" And he responds, ""It's someone who's never won the Oscar."" And there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film. After a meeting with a studio executive (Feuerstein), who tells him his script is no good, Brooks then turns to his successful writer friend, Jeff Bridges, who suggests he contacts the same muse who helped him. A muse being any one of the nine mythological Greek daughters of Zeus who are divine sources of inspiration, but in this case it is the mentally unstable Sharon Stone. What goes for comedy in this film, has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse. The muse is demanding gifts from Tiffany's from him and must be placed in an expensive hotel suite, later on she will occupy the bedroom of his house, with him forced to sleep in the guest house. He also must run errands for her and cater to all her whims. She in return helps him out by suggesting he go to the aquarium in Long Beach and find something there to use for an idea. That dumbness prevails, and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have Jim Carrey star in, is supposed to be his way of saying that Hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap, or doesn't care. His wife will also be inspired by the muse, she will go successfully into the cookie business, a source of some more whining comedy on his part. This is ""I LOVE LUCY"" kind of humor. That this film is about making money being tantamount in Hollywood to creativity, is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept. If you make a satire, it better be funny, or if it is a more serious film, it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive. To have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate, as Brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner, grousing about the demands of his muse, the attention she gives to his wife instead of him, how Steven Spielberg snubbed him, and how cruel it is to be in Hollywood if you are a creative person. This slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film. If you really had to see this film, the only reason I could think of doing so, was to see the attractive Sharon Stone as a muse. Even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny, she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance. At least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"For 20 years, Albert Brooks' movies have been acclaimed as some of the funniest and smartest comedies around, although the general public has always been less appreciative of his efforts than the critics. Instead of expressing bitterness about his lack of commercial appeal, however, Brooks has turned the situation into the premise for ""The Muse,"" in which he plays a screenwriter named Steven Phillips who's so desperate for a hit, he's willing to spend every dime he has -- and probably several he doesn't -- for the services of Sarah (Sharon Stone), a vivacious blonde said to have the power to inspire marketable scripts. Although she charges no fees upfront, Sarah does require a good deal of pampering and placating: a $1700-a-night suite at The Four Seasons and trinkets from Tiffany's are barely enough to hold her interest. Trekking through some of the same territory covered by ""Bowfinger,"" ""The Muse"" lampoons Hollywood's tendency to accept everything and everyone at face value. No one bothers to question Sarah's credentials; they just look at her client list. Similarly, the young studio executives Steven has to contend with may be brainless and amoral, but they look smart and stylish, which may mean more to their bosses than possessing any sense of tact or taste. One, who turns out to be Steven Spielberg's cousin Stan (a brilliant cameo by Steven Wright), helpfully tells Steven to make his movie ""in color, people love color."" But though ""The Muse"" is a more consistent satire than ""Bowfinger,"" it's not a prime example of Brooks' talent. The wild imagination he demonstrated in the hilarious ""Defending Your Life"" is tempered here, and the jokes, while generally clever, don't have the sting of his writing in ""Lost in America"" or ""Mother."" It's almost as if Brooks shared with Steven the desire to create something that wouldn't create ripples in the mainstream. The movie's big accomplishment turns out to be giving Stone an opportunity to display her previously unseen lighter side, a challenge the actress eagerly accepts. She's serenely confident as Sarah, who would be insufferable were it not for her disarming smile and upbeat attitude. It's easily Stone's sharpest and most impressive work since her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Casino."" As Steven's wife Laura -- who gets a little inspiration of her own from the muse -- Andie MacDowell is quietly charming, but the scene stealers here are the directors Brooks coaxed into participating onscreen. Martin Scorsese's hyperactive rant about his proposed remake of ""Raging Bull"" (""with a thin guy, I mean a real thin guy"") is funny enough, but James Cameron's appearance is almost enough to make you forgive him for that ""king of the world"" remake at the 1998 Oscars.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"THE MUSE (1999) **3/4. Directed by Albert Brooks.Written by Brooks and Monica Johnson. Photography, Thomas Ackerman. Editing, Peter Teschner. Production design, Dina Lipton. Music, Elton John. Produced by Herb Nanas. Cast: Albert Brooks (Steven Phillips), Sharon Stone (Sarah), Andie MacDowell (Laura Phillips), Mark Feuerstein (Josh Martin), Jeff Bridges (Jack Warrick), Steven Wright (Stan Spielberg), Mario Opiniato (The European), cameos by Cybill Shepherd, Lorenzo Lamas, Jennifer Tilly, Stacey Travis, Rob Reiner, Wolfgang Puck, JamesCameron and Martin Scorsese (themselves). A USA Films/October Films release. 97 minutes. PG-13. What fun a movie database is! Under ""Brooks"" as a last name, I found 140 actors, 112 actresses (including the legendary Louise Brooks), 10 composers. There are 21 directors, of whom 4 are biggies as well as writer-directors: Albert, Mel, James L. and the late Richard. The first three are also actors (with James L. only occasionally). I really don't know what the significance of all this is, except that the four Brooks are brothers in talent. And that I like all of them A lot. Albert Brooks was born to the radio comedian Harry Einstein, who thought it would be funny to name his son Albert. Albert-now-Brooks has been all over the big and the small screen. The Muse is the sixth film he has directed -- after Real Life, Modern Romance, Lost in America, Defending Your Life, and Mother. He is a funny man, an artist and ""auteur"" who, somewhat like Woody Allen, variously puts his neuroses and insecurities on the screen, along with a sort of pessimistic view of fellow humans, society, values and all that, as his titles indicate. The Muse fits well into Albert's ""oeuvre,"" but adds the problems of an aging man. Brooks (now 52) plays Steven, a Hollywood screen writer married, with children (wife Laura is played by Andie MacDowell), With at least 17 scripts to his credit and a single Oscar nomination, this makes him only a mid-tier success, but in showbiz it still means a lot of money. Having received a Humanitarian award which he does not take too seriously (he explains to his youngest daughter that it's what they give people who have no Oscars), the writer, who puts a lot of faith in his latest script, is shocked to hear from his producer that he, Steven, has ""lost his edge."" This translates into becoming a pariah in Tinseltown. The first part of the movie, with Steven's bewilderment and growing despair, is a familiar but still colorfully clever expose of the film business shallowness, stupidity, cruelty, fake friendships, hypocrisy, opportunism, etc. Unlike most older, traditional satires on this theme, The Muse, in keeping with today's trends, brings out the true fact of studio executives being younger than ever ( practically ""kids""), ignoramuses with no brains, judgment, experience, knowledge of film, its past, its history. This is an aspect that could and should have been expanded, but Brooks, instead of going for the jugular, decided to switch from realism to fantasy. He had a gimmick. Helpless and panicky Steven goes to true pal Jeff Bridges for help. The latter avows that his recent success (look at his manor house!) came from having a Muse, a true descendant of ancient Greece's mythological daughters of Zeus. Since Hollywood people will believe anything, Steven contacts her. She is Sarah (Sharon Stone), a chic and weirder than weird creature whom prospective clients must approach with outrageously expensive gifts from Tiffany's. ""Beware of Greeks bearing gifts"" gets a nice twist here. How Sarah works her magic is not really explained. Somehow she does it by simply being there and occasionally correcting some ideas pitched by filmmakers. As a muse, she inspires, but she's also like mythology's Pythia who delivered pithy oracles. Sarah, at first, second and subsequent sights, feels like an air-head, a capricious, spoiled beauty. She charges no fees, but Steven absolutely must cater to all her many whims, starting with her moving from a guest house which now bores her to the Four Seasons Hotel. She specifies what and where her suite must be, that she needs a limousine, and other extravagances. Of course Steven foots this bill ($1,700 a night) and the rest, becomes her errand boy and must obey all of her eccentricities. His finances suffer, as does, initially, his marriage, until his suspicious wife believes the unbelievable, in fact makes friends with Sarah who, in another move, invades the couple's home. The next invention comes when, on Sarah's advice, Laura becomes her own capitalist. In the meantime, Sarah's presence has given Steven a bright idea (actually dumb but with box-office potential) for a new film. Brooks the actor can be maniacal, as here, which may or may not be your cup of tea. It is, for me, even though his Steven is not especially likable. Brooks the writer-director is a balloon-deflator. The Muse is no exception. Sharon Stone, in a wonderful --if one-tone--performance, plays her mysterious self to the hilt. Is she a devilishly clever, inventive gold-digger or what? An answer comes near the end, but it neither satisfactory nor convincing. The fakeness and crassness of Hollywood are, I repeat, not given enough play, except for some comic and/or funny-painful bits. No longer persona grata at a studio, Steven forced to park his car where the proles do sweats out miles on foot for his appointment with Mr. Spielberg -- who turns out to Steven Spielberg's know-nothing cousin. It is a hilarious scene. Or else, at a reception at Spago ( Wolfgang Puck's super-trendy eatery), Steven and an European with impenetrable English have a discussion that would enchant Groucho Marx. There are many walk-on roles or cameos by movie celebrities, some of them Sarah's clients. Note the constant plugs for Spago. Confusions and mixups a la Feydeau work well. Some details are clever, such as Steven's not being tanned as so many others are. The message of the movie has to be that if you're down and out in Beverly Hills, the very fact of believing that a muse can help you makes you help yourself.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Steven Phillips (Brooks) is sitting in a posh restaurant with a young studio executive that says he's lost his edge. ""What can I do to fix it?"" Brooks asks, but he says it's beyond fixing. ""But I just got the Humanitarian Award!"" he fires back, ""Oh come on, everyone gets that."" The Muse is a perfect example of the way that young Hollywood stars and executives are shaping what type of movies that we see in the next millennium. It also shows what this young movement does to the aging workers who've been there awhile. When Steven sees a mysterious woman getting into a cab when he comes to ask his friend Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) for advice he at first begins to think that he is having an affair. But in his desperation, Jack feels sorry for him and tells him that she is a muse. A muse is a child of Zeus and is supposed to inspire all creativity. (Just a little update for those of us who didn't pay attention in history.) Steven decides to consult the muse, (Stone) who turns to want more than anybody in Hollywood are paying for their services. Decked out in a Four Seasons suite, she makes him be at her beck and call, in exchange he's starting to form an idea about a Jim Carrey comedy in a water park. She also helps inspire Steven's wife Laura (Andie McDowell) to become the next Mrs. Fields. She two investigators of a local mentor hospital show up at the front door looking for her...they begin to wonder. The film turns in a great performance by Stone. Her wackiness reminded me of some of her craziness scenes in Casino. Albert Brooks also turns in a fine screenplay that constantly moving and funny. But the film also raises the idea of what will happen when the Sarah Michelle Gellar's of today turn 30? What will happen to the industry then? If your looking for a fun film to see, go out and see The Muse which gets *** stars. The Young-Uns: The film contains a brief view of Sharon Stone's butt.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"""You have to turn around, park in the lot and walk to the building. You don't have a drive-on."" ""Excuse me?"" ""You don't have a drive-on, you have a walk-on."" ""Is that the worst a person could get or is there like a crawl-on?"" Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie McDowell, Jeff Bridges. Rated PG-13. The movie is about Muses: descendants of the Gods said to be able to inspire artists. I think Albert Brooks is a God. He hasn't made a bad movie in his entire career (granted, a 6 film career, but six good films in a row is a streak any filmmaker should be -- and is -- envious of). At their worst his films are funny; at their best they are masterpieces of comic precision and intelligent, tasteful humor. The Muse, his new film, is a delightful experience. Charming, hilarious and very Brook-ish, it is a worthy addition to what has been an inordinately successful 20-year directing career. Brooks handles his tricky material perfectly, cooking up an impeccable combination of the supernatural, the off-beat and the Hollywood inside jokes. Our protagonist is Steven Phillips, a heretofore successful screenwriter who has just been fired. Why? Because he has ""lost his edge"". Understandably Steven asks what that means. I began to wonder myself. You hear that so often in the movie, tv and book business that it has become a staple phrase and yet I don't know what the ""edge"" is and how one can ""lose"" it. That is what everyone tells Steven when they read the latest script and yet nobody is able to explain what it means. They all advise that he take a year off work, get that mystical ""edge"" back. That's not an option for him because he's no billionaire and he has a family to feed. He's left up the creek without a paddle; he has no idea what's wrong with his work or, more importantly, how he can fix it. He pleads with his enviably successful screenwriter buddy Jack (Jeff Bridges) for help. Jack divulges that he employs the services of a Muse. That's right -- a Muse -- the mythical woman said to be able to breathe inspiration into anyone with writer's/painter's/actor's/author's block. The Muse's name is Sarah, and she's a tough cookie. First you have to get her to ""take your case"", mainly by showering her with lavishly expensive gifts. If she does decide to take you on you have to obey her every command in return for alleged inspiration. She takes Steve on. She orders that he put her up in a suite at the Four Seasons, run countless errands for her and attend to her every wish. If he does, she insists, he'll write a script that will make him so much money he may neverh ave to write another one again. The relationship between Steve and sarah gets weird. Brooks, bless his soul, never lets The Muse develop into a romantic comedy. What he does do, however, is have Sarah move in with Steve. At that point, various guests come to Steve's home looking to use the Muse; people like Martin Scorcese (who wants to remake Raging Bull with a really thin guy) and James Cameron (no Titanic sequel for him, poor fella) all showing up seeking inspiration. As if that wasn't enough, Sarah decides to assist Steve's wife (Andie McDowell) in starting her own ""Mrs. Fields"" style baking business, a fact which deeply troubles Steve. The film's biggest commodity, of course, is the jokes, the jokes, the jokes. They keep a-flyin', and the amazing thing is that they all work. Well, almost. As a matter of fact, the ratio of gags to laughs rivals that of Brooks classics such as the untouchable Defending Your Life. This one may not be as profound or emotionally affecting as that film, but it is at least just as funny. Its claim to fame, however, is Sharon Stone as the leading lady in one of her only comedic roles. And make no mistake, she is wonderful as the mysterious title character. I doubt she will become a top-billed comedianne anytime soon, but ""this will do"" wouldn't do her performance justice. Equally successful is Andie McDowell, whom I didn't appreciate as an actress up until this movie. Albert Brooks is as good a comic as he is a director: his performance is typical but also typically effective. Unlike most other Albert Brooks films there is not much of substance in The Muse, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. It's even better if you know your movies: the countless Hollywood inside jokes can be easy to miss if you don't get them. Even if you're not an insider you can still enjoy this fluffy light comedy, a hilarious ode -- not a spoof but a tribute -- to Hollywood; a film that emphasizes that there's no business like showbusiness. ©1999 Eugene Novikov‰ Sent via Deja.com http://www.deja.com/ Share what you know.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Albert Brooks, who last gave us a wryly cynical meditation on mother-and-son relationships with MOTHER, turns now to a wryly cynical meditation on Hollywood and inspiration with the aptly titled THE MUSE. Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a moderately successful Hollywood screenwriter who suddenly finds he's lost `his edge.' In desperation he turns to friend Jack (Bridges), who introduces him to a girl named Sarah (Stone), whom Jack claims is a muse. Or rather, one of The Muses, a source of divine inspiration. And Sarah seems to be the real thing inspiring greatness in Bridges' character (he wins an Oscar) and a dozen really big celebrities who make cameos throughout the picture (which becomes half the fun, so I won't spoil their identities). Steven's wife (MacDowell) even gets in on the action, as Sarah inspires her to bake cookies and eventually open a bakery. Of course, Brooks is typically hilarious here with humor that is at once dry and at the same time over the top. But he lost with me with the end product that Sarah helps him create  an idiotic comedy script that sounds like a cross between ACE VENTURA and `The Beverly Hillbillies.' It is even designed to star Jim Carrey. I should hope that if I get a muse, she brings me a better script than that. Any Albert Brooks fan will enjoy his latest. It's not the home run that say, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, is, but it's a classy film in an era of low-class projects. Let me add the ironic footnote that Brooks himself ended up distributing this picture through teeny outlet October Films, just as his character is nearly forced to do in the movie. You see, in the real Hollywood, the greater your artistry, the lower on the totem pole you have to go to find work. That's how it really works.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"Albert Brooks saves the day, just in the nick of time. With a very poor summer for movies, Brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up, and does so in a positive way. While this may not be his finest work, ""The Muse"" still shakes up some delightful humor. In Albert Brook's latest comedy, he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter (Brooks) who's losing his edge, as his business partners say. In desperation, he goes to see his friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past. He asks Jack for some help, and recieves word of a real life Muse, that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career. So Brooks seeks the muse named Sarah (Sharon Stone), and is suckered into buying her expensive, food etc. as a sort of payment. The real punch line however, doesn't come until the end. It really makes you wonder, how screenwriters really get their ideas, could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street? The idea itself is provoking and Brooks does it in a hilarious manner. Speaking of Brooks, he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter. Every time he graces the screen, I can't help but start laughing. Albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character . The real problem with the film lies with Sharon Stone. She wasn't likeable at all. Brooks had the right idea with her occupation, but she never pulled through. In a way, she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak. Luckily Brooks could clean up the mess, and cover for Stone's mishap. It was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance, because ""The Muse"" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy. On a brighter note, Andie Macdowell was also charming as Brook's wife. She is always a nice addition as a supporting actress, because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in. The funniest moments in ""The Muse"" in my opinion were the cameos by James Cameron and Martin Scorsese. I mean imagine, Brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking Sharon Stone for advice, like it was something out of the ordinary. It was just plain hilarious. It just adds to the satire joke, of how Directors get ideas. Brilliant move by Brooks. As I mentioned before, the film is a satire much like it's proceeder Bowfinger, which came out a few weeks before. Unlike Bowfinger, this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes, it's rather a witty and humorous look at Hollywood. ""Bowfinger"" had it's moments, but had quite a few problems that were never worked out, but ""The Muse"" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour. By the end of the film, you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it. For once I'm not fully disappointed, because the film didn't slow down, it kept moving, even with some flaws. Thumbs up to Brooks for his brave effort. I think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"In, ""The Muse"" Albert Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a Hollywood screenwriter who after winning a Humanitarian Award for his work is dumped by his studio. They claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them. He knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over. So he turns to his ""best"" friend, Jack (Jeff Bridges) another screenwriter who's enjoyed success after success. On the way over to Jack's house Steven sees Jack helping an attractive woman (Sharon Stone) into a cab and begins to think: Is he having an affair? When confronted, Jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is, in fact, a muse, a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity, and has helped him garner his success. ""She doesn't do any actual writing,"" he is told, ""but inspires you."" Steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks Jack to call her up to see if she'll take Steven on as a new client. Jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that Steven bring her a present, preferably something from Tiffany's. After the meeting the muse, Sarah decides to take on Steven, but at a price: She wants a suite at the Four Seasons and wants Steven to perform odd tasks for her (like bringing her salads in the middle of the night.) Steven's wife (Andy MacDowell) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon. Steven confesses everything and, although at first suspicious, she later allows Sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life. The only question for Steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her. And that's a question only time will tell. ""The Muse"" is Albert Brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor (he co-wrote with Monica Johnson) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works (""Defending Your Life"" and ""Mother""). The problem lies in the script, and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor, there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners. It has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential. But, I like Albert Brooks in this film and I think that we can all identify with Steven Phillips a little bit. He may whine and complain, but he just wants to support his family and be happy. And I like Sharon Stone in this movie too; it's a nice change of pace for her. And I also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of Rob Reiner, James Cameron and Martin Scorsese. And although ""The Muse"" doesn't have as much to say about Hollywood as Robert Altman's ""The Player"" I still left the theater feeling good. And that's something I wish I got out of more movies.

"Muse, The",Short,2018,"USA Films Reviewed by Harvey Karten Director: Albert Brooks Writer: Albert Brooks & Monica Johnson Cast: Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Jeff Bridges, James Cameron, Bobby Edner, Mark Feuerstein, Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, Stacey Travis, Steve Valentine, Steven Wright Coincidentally, the New York Times Circuits section that came out on the day of the critics' screening of ""The Muse"" highlighted a directory of software that can be used by screenwriters. The software includes Plots Unlimited, which gives the writer logical options among 5,000 situations; WritePro, which takes the user through essential rules for creating well-written material; John Truby's Blockbuster, for brainstorming a plot; and DramaticaPro, which advises the scripter about motivations, inner thoughts, moral dilemmas and courses of action. I'd guess that whoever actually does get a play onto the screen using computer help is going to receive critical notices that call the movie ""apparently written by a computer."" If computers are not the answer, just how does a dramatist get ideas that are saleable? Chances are most who are successful at this difficult and highly competitive trade have the knack, the talent, the genius at knowing what will come across to an audience. For some gifted people, the notions for new movies pop into their heads annually. Look at Woody Allen, for example, who no sooner finishes one work than he is busy filming another. Others need inspiration: they're the kinds of people who may go for a decade or so without a single good idea and suddenly become enkindled. ""The Muse,"" which is directed, co-written, and stars Albert Brooks deals with the latter situation. Brooks, performing in the role of Steven Phillips, a screenwriter who has lost his edge, has just been fired by Paramount Studios and doesn't know how he's going to feed his family of four. ""The Muse"" is an imaginative yarn, yet another movie following closely on the heels of ""Bowfinger."" Like that vehicle for Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, this one sends up the unique culture which is Hollywood--a town filled with a small number of successful studio department heads, producers, writers and directors and afflicted as well with many times that many wannabees and has-beens. Brooks, one of our most talented and successful comics who has done great work in ""Defending Your Life"" (considered by one critic to be ""imperfect, like all of Brooks's movies, but hard to dislike""), and ""Lost in America"" (co-written, as is this one, by Monica Johnson, a send-up of yuppies), is true to form with a movie having a sit-comish design. Brooks, who was a regular on TV programs hosted by Ed Sullivan, Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin, frames his comedies around punch lines, presumably to be judged by how many sequences draw the laughs or chuckles and how many fall flat. Happily, most of the gags this time around can be appreciated, especially by an audience of regular moviegoers who are hip to Hollywood society with its celebrity chefs, producers who do lunch with their talent, and actors who consider themselves princes and princesses deserving all the benefits of a world enamored of American cinema. Brooks's character, Steven Phillips, has just received the ""humanitarian"" award at a dinner presided over by Cybill Shepherd, who announces that the man has written seventeen films, ""some of which are about the human condition."" At home with his wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell) and his two daughters, he is asked what the award means and explains that this is what is given to people who do not win Oscars. Much of the humor throughout the 97-minute movie are of this self-deprecatory nature as Brooks runs through the role of a slightly neurotic and anxiety-ridden author. (This is sort of role that could have been played as well by Woody Allen.) Phillips's friend, Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), advises him to consult an actual living muse-- explaining that the muses in Greek mythology are nine children of Zeus whose role is to inspire people in the arts. Phillips consults with Sarah (Sharon Stone), the alleged source of inspiration, hoping to get back on track. He soon finds that Sarah is more a princess than a god, insisting that if she is to do her job properly she must be put up in the city's most expensive hotel, be treated to expensive gifts, and even given the run of Phillips's home. At various points in the film, Sarah is visited by the grateful people whom she has inspired, including Martin Scorsese (who does an amusing job as a motormouth who seems to have overdosed on Starbucks), Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, and James Cameron--all playing themselves. If Brooks successfully performs in the role of an annoying pest, constantly sniveling about the hand he's been dealt by unappreciative producers, Sharon Stone is even more notable in her portrayal of a woman who exploits her godlike position to extract expensive gratuities. The point to ""The Muse"" is that the creative people in Hollywood are on a different planet, one which has furnished the chic set nationwide with such benefits as bottled water, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, and in this case, the world's best cookies. The picture has even broader implications in portraying Hollywood as a dream factory which produces utter fantasies (such as the belief in living muses) that allow us to leave behind our real lives for a couple of hours each week. If some of the jokes fall flat, chalk those sections of the movie up to the periods that writer-director Albert Brooks's mentor was out to lunch. Fortunately, there's enough good fun in this yarn to make us believe that the highly talented Brooks has spent most of his creative time in the presence of his muse.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"THE PIANO is one of perhaps two films I've seen lately (the other being THE SECRET GARDEN) which are really original, and which show something deep and interesting about human nature. THE PIANO has Holly Hunter as an unmarried Scottish mother who is married by contract to a New Zealand settler, played by Sam Neill. Hunter is mute, and achieves self-expression through her piano, which she takes on the voyage. Hunter is incredibly strong-willed; even she cannot understand where her will comes from. She is tamed, gradually, by Harvey Keitel, a wild man associate of Neill's who has adopted some of the Maori ways. It is the romance of Hunter and Keitel that forms the basis of the film, and also serves as the rock on which the film's sexual commentary stands. This movie is mainly about sex, in the sense that it is sex that stands between men and women, and draws them together, and sex that divides us as individuals, and draws us together. This is the only film I can remember seeing which has sexual relations as a main theme, and which is not also boring (e.g., HENRY AND JUNE, THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING.) All of the acting in the movie is good, including the little girl who plays Hunter's daughter, but Holly Hunter's performance is one of the most remarkable I have ever seen. She never says a word, except in voiceovers, and yet she manages to convey a character as clearly as any actress has. She is really remarkable. She should certainly be nominated for an Academy Award on the basis of this performance. Susan Campion's direction is also excellent. Watching these people, one is struck over and over with recognition of similar events in one's own life. Campion keeps any one of these characters from being stereotyped (I especially appreciated this with Neill's character, who could easily have been cast as a greedy, insensitive lout). The screenplay is filled with remarkable images. For example, the hoop skirt tent, Hunter being carried in through the surf, the wedding photograph, Neill's ambiguous viewing of Keitel and Hunter.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"The Piano Directed by Jane Campion Starring Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, Anna Paquin Australia, 1993 Rated R (strong sexual content, intense images, adult themes) A+ Jane Campion wrote and directed The Piano, one of the most eloquent films about the closeness of passion and repression I've ever seen. Yes, she is a woman but, unlike what many people have said, The Piano is not a feminist film and isn't about women. It is, firstly, about lust, then restriction, and, finally but least importantly, about love. It is a masterpiece saturated in evocative images and a film that succeeds, perhaps, because a woman is behind the scenes. Campion creates an otherworldly place in the forests of New Zealand and she understands the emotional power of eroticism. She doesn't go for what many so-called feminist films employ: she doesn't victimize any of her characters or make any of them criminals, either, which is a great asset to a film that portrays the complexity of the situations we get into because of passion. A nineteenth century woman named Ada (Holly Hunter) brings her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin), to New Zealand. Ada is mute, presumably by choice, and is arranged to wed Stewart (Sam Neill), a British man she has never met. When she arrives in New Zealand, her husband refuses to take her beloved piano, her only source of expression, back to his house. He says it is too heavy. Flora, Ada's illegitimate daughter, is a very vocal child and helps her mother demand the piano be brought back to the house. Stewart does not realize the piano, over Ada's mute years, has become synonymous to her heart and soul. Without it, she has no means of speaking in the language of emotion and is completely miserable and soulless. There is an uneasiness between Ada and Stewart already. Baines (Harvey Keitel), a British immigrant who has abandoned his native land's customs in favor of Maori attitudes of freedom, offers Stewart a good amount of land for the piano after he takes Ada to the beach and hears her play. Some of cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh's most beautiful images here are those of Ada with her piano on a deserted expanse of the beach. Baines is struck by Ada's frightening intimacy with her piano and becomes attracted to her. Ada refuses to give her piano, her soul, to this man, an illiterate. Stewart becomes angry and tells her she must make sacrifices for her family. The piano, which is explored in great, stunning detail by Dryburgh's camera, is sold to Baines in exchange for the land. He requests lessons from Ada but when she consents, he will not play. Instead, he offers her her piano in exchange for his sexual gratification. She will ""earn"" her piano back key by key if she lifts her dress and lies with him. At first, she refuses. She finally accepts the offer; I'm not sure whether if it was in a state of longing for her piano or a state of longing for sex. She is not a slut; what she feels is a primal human feeling. It's too easy to say she simply falls in love with Baines. In the end, she does have a deep love for him but she attains it gradually: first she lies with him for her piano; soon, it is simply for her desire; later, it becomes an entanglement of love and sex, maybe even of rebellion. Stewart is portrayed as a cold man at first and Baines, an obsessed man. The Piano makes them deeper. This is a thick film and we sympathize with Stewart who cannot win Ada's love or sexual attention, and we are allowed to witness the unexpected tenderness of Baines. He is truly a romantic, though he initially seeks romance with Ada through obsessive sexual requests that border on blackmail. Flora is mischievous and her decisions are strange. She is outspoken and tattles on her mother and Baines, which leads to the most shattering sequence in the entire film. Shot very dramatically, this sequence has Stewart, who trusted Ada to stay away from Baines, chopping off her finger with an ax. We, thankfully, don't see the actual violent act but, even more painful, we see Ada's face turning blue and her absolute horror. In the climactic scene, Baines, Ada, and Flora sail away from New Zealand and away from Stewart to live together. Ada demands her ""spoiled"" piano be thrown overboard and, in a suicidal attempt, gets her foot caught in the rope. In a scene as haunting as the one previously mentioned, Ada is tugged to the bottom of the ocean. For several moments, she simply waits to die. Suddenly, she realizes what she has done and wishes to live. When she finally makes her way to the surface, she has been mysteriously redeemed. Her soul (her piano) lies disintegrating at the bottom of the sea and she no longer is repressed. Her piano-playing need not be her only source of expression and pleasure anymore: she has discovered life, love, and passion. Perhaps I have made The Piano seem sentimental and gooey. It is moody, definitely, but it is not melodramatically romantic. It is romantic, yes, and it sees love and passion as salvation, but it also sees love and lust as clawing. The Piano is about bondage and this is highlighted by everything from the women's tight corsets to the inner struggle within the characters. By Jane Campion's screenplay not giving the outlet of language to Ada, Holly Hunter is repressed somewhat. In one of the best performances I've seen this decade, or of any decade for that matter, Hunter says everything with her face, body, and fingers. One critic suggested that people are imagining Hunter's physical expressions, however, Ada becomes real, despite the character's enigmatic aura. Hunter, though she gives the film's stand-out performance, is not the only gifted actor in The Piano. Let's not forget Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill, men who are bound: Keitel's character by sexual and romantic obsession; Neill's by jealousy and sexual inadequacy. And Anna Paquin is strange and precocious as Ada's daughter who must stand up for her mother but is repressed by her humorous knack for telling tall-tales and her desire to lie and tell her mother's secrets. Stuart Dryburgh, using the photographic technique known as Autochrome, supplies a great deal of overwhelming intensity, mysticism, and otherworldliness to The Piano. There are moments when the film is warm and glowing with red, and other times when it is cold and dark blue. Dryburgh is even able to shoot the bizarre intimacy between Ada and her piano, Ada and her daughter, and Ada and Baines. There is a certain beauty about Ada's fingers gently caressing and falling upon piano keys. The Piano is a fiercely erotic film and there are scenes between Ada and Baines that are heated and detailed. These scenes are really graphic, the most graphic I've ever seen, but they are not gratuitous or pornographic and Dryburgh lights and frames them without flaw. His photography catches every nuance of New Zealand and the faces of The Piano's characters. Jane Campion is one of the few greatly acclaimed and successful female directors around (I refer not to women's directorial ability but to their obscurity in the field; sadly, I remember only Lina Wertmuller as another such successful and talented female director, but she worked ages ago). There is both a universality and complexity to The Piano and it is one of those rare films that is multi-faceted, shaking, and engaging. Campion's point of view on the world is extremely fascinating and is different from a male's perspective. She is one of the greatest directors, male or female, of the 90s decade and The Piano is one of the most haunting and poetic films I've ever seen.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Seen in English with French subtitles at the Gaumont Gran Ecran Cinema, Place d' Italia, Paris Rating: (1 to 10) ... ""off the scale""... Rated ""RV"" for ""required viewing"" Since causing a seven-minute standing ovation at its world premiere in Cannes this year, Jane Campion's film has sent waves of anticipation across the Atlantic for its impending opening in North America. Upon seeing it, you may wonder if seven minutes was enough recognition for this brilliant film! Campion (ANGEL AT MY TABLE, SWEETIE) earned her Palm d' Or award (the first ever for a woman director) for this brilliant, timeless film. THE PIANO is destined to join the pantheon of classics inhabited by CHILDREN OF THE PARADISE, SHOP ON MAIN STREET, THE HEIRESS, and CITIZEN KANE. Its simple dignity and heart stopping beauty will literally take your breath away. Campion's deft direction and brilliantly original screenplay have drawn stunning performances from the unlikely cast of Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel. (After RESERVOIR DOGS and THE BAD LIEUTENANT, the last place you'd expect to see Keitel is in a reverently hushed Art House....) The three leads form a love triangle, centered around a mute woman, (whose unbreakable will transforms all of the participants). Campion exercises remarkable skill in keeping the amazing performances subdued enough to not overpower the beautifully tender story-line. Holly Hunter's heart-stopping, speechless performance demands multiple viewings, and could well become a text for film students. Actress and director had every opportunity to go too far in making this a mawkish, sentimental ""shoe-in"" for the Oscars. Their restraint and subtly lets the brilliance of Hunter's performance creep up on you, and allows you the freedom to ""take in"" the rest of the film. You will not recognize Hunter as the ""perky"" gamin from BROADCAST NEWS or MISS FIRECRACKER. Her wan face transmits ""messages"" and subtexts more effectively than any performance I've seen since the advent of sound in films. Unlike those of silent films, Campion's characters are richly drawn, complex, and may leave you vacillating in your sympathy with all of the characters. Though a startlingly original film, THE PIANO has a lot in common with the best of great Silent cniema. It has a simple premise, a plot that maintains the clarity of a biblical parable, and wonderful use of symbols and counterpoints ... a woman ""without a voice"" in a man's world ... a piano left out in the rain ... a small child running through the mud with angel wings ... a church pageant about Bluebeard's wives ... the ""fore-shadowing"" of a limb being amputated.... The film leaves many stunning images indelibly engraved in your memory (I saw the film five nights ago, and it's still with me.) Lee Swarth's incredibly clear soundtrack captures the emotion contained in each piano note, the incessant buzz of flies, the constant sound of mud and rain. (Michael Nyman is responsible for the compelling score.) The cinematography (didn't catch name off the titles) is an equal match for the magnificence of story and performance. New Zealand literally looks like the ends of the earth though this telling camera; often the interior scenes resemble lovingly hand-tinted photos from the last century. On the surface, it would be tempting to label this a ""woman's film,"" this time about a wronged mail-order bride from the last century, who has to endure the indignities of her husband's ""property rights."" Campion's screenplay, however, defines Ada (Hunter) as a complete and complex woman, whose ""will"" at times attracts or repulses you. The men are no less fully drawn than Hunter's character. The performances so pull you into the present moment that you won't be able to anticipate the film's ending. We only hear Hunter's voice briefly, at the beginning of the film, as ""the voice in my mind."" (She's been mute since she was 6, cause unknown). Hunter's forbidding demeanor is counterpointed by her free-spirited child-daughter (a phenomenal performance by Anna Paquin). At times, mother and daughter seem like aspects of the same person, the daughter almost ""the inner child"" exposed to the outside world. They share a secret language, which supplements Hunter's frequent need to spell out her needs with a pad and pencil. Hunter's character needs little interpretation for those drawn into her orbit. Her face tells all. Hunter's piano is her ""voice,"" which she plays with a soul-shattering touch. (Throughout the film I was marveling over how convincing Hunter was on the keyboard, wondering who was ""really"" playing it, and deciding to buy the soundtrack--the credits shocked me with the line ""piano solos played by Holly Hunter""--her amazing range of talents doesn't stop with acting!) Hunter, a mute, unwed mother, is married off, sight unseen, to a recluse in New Zealand (Sam Neill). Hunter, daughter, and piano are unceremoniously dumped off on a blustery, remote beach, where her husband-to-be has missed his appointed meeting. One of the most unforgettable images is of mother and daughter spending their first night ashore beneath her hoop skirt, which makes an impromptu ""igloo."" Neil hadn't planned on transporting a piano, so it is left on the beach ""to be picked up later."" Later, the look on Hunter's face through a rain streaked window (echoing her unspeakable horror over the piano warping on the beach) ranks with Lillian Gish's visage through the sand-covered window in THE WIND. (In the Paris theatre where I saw THE PIANO, I could hear several members of a sophisticated-looking audience suck in their breath at that point ... by the end of the film I was very used to that sound.) Without consulting his new wife, Neil decides to swap the piano (including ""lessons"") to back-woodsman Harvey Keitel for a few acres of land. Keitel suggested the deal, having had a catharsis of sorts while watching Hunter play the piano, still boxed, on the beach. Hunter is eventually drawn into a labrynth of negotiations and deceptions to maintain access to her ""voice."" Keitel is gradually transformed by his ""lessons,"" and by the film's end, you've released every prejudice or preconceived notion you had about his character. The three leads are wonderfully backlight by a rich supporting cast, (an ingredient entirely missing from big budget ""star vehicles""). THE PIANO is the type of film Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to make. It has every ingredient destined to make it a classic as enduring as THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, (another film made without Hollywood's support.) A seven-minute standing ovation at Cannes? Not half long enough, in my book, for a woman from the other side of the world who's taught us to dream again, and who has delivered the promise that enduring film classics can and will be made in our lifetime.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"PIANO, THE (director/writer: Jane Campion; cinematographer: Stuart Dryburgh; cast: Holly Hunter (Ada), Harvey Keitel (Baines), Sam Neill (Stewart), Anna Paquin (Flora), Geneviève Lemon (Nessie), Kerry Walker (Aunt Morag), 1993-Australia) The tune emanating from The Piano is a passionate one, coming forth on a desolate New Zealand coastline, far removed from European culture, where a piano is seen as something peculiar to possess in such a backward area of the world. It is used symbolically to represent the works of civilization that can soothe the savage beast, if the beast is lonely and willing to listen to something he usually doesn't listen to. The underlying premise of the film is one of communication or lack of it in a world that can be cold, and of how easy it is to never find love in such a world. The coastline is a place where the sky and sea are dismally gray, and it rains all the time; where the native Maoris, with their tattooed faces, and the white settlers of this nineteenth century tale are living in a marshy forest, with the settlers trying to live by the rules they were accustomed to in Europe, but are now faced with muddy roads and squalid living conditions, making their life almost unbearable; and to top that off, the two diverse groups seem unable to see each other's point of view, as the Maoris mock the settlers under their breath and the settlers treat the natives as if they were children. It is a place where the characters either can't talk (the bride), or can't listen (the new husband), or are spiteful (the daughter), in a film that unrelentingly studies the affects of erotic yearnings in a restrictive society... And who can forget the powerful image it leaves the viewer, of the piano left abandoned in its crate against the forlorn backdrop of the rushing surf and the desolate beach! Ada (Holly) is a young mute in her early thirties, for some inexplicable reason, she has not been able to talk since she was 6 years old. Her voiceover says, ""This is not the sound of my voice you are hearing; it is the sound of my mind.""She is seen in the film's opening arriving in New Zealand by boat and then being rowed by canoe ashore, coming all the way from her native Scotland for an arranged mail-order marriage at her father's insistence. She is accompanied by her 8 year old daughter Flora (Paquin), as she awaits on the beach with all her possessions to meet her unseen British emigrant husband Stewart (Neill), who is trying to make a go of it by cultivating the land in this bush country.The only two things she cares about in life are with her on the beach: her daughter and her piano. The contradiction of a deaf mute playing music, is underscored by the tremendous joyous feeling that it exudes in Ada, as it is her only real contact with the world, and the piano is something that this fiercely proud woman cannot live without. She is soon met by the anxious groom, seen trying to comb his unruly hair, but who doesn't have the presence of mind to give the ladies a kindly welcome, instead orders the Maoris accompanying him to start bringing all the luggage with them except for the piano. He is not listening to his new bride who writes him anxious notes and talks in a hand sign language to her daughter who translates, as she urgently tells him the piano is hers and she must keep it, even, above her other worldly possessions. But her insensitive and demanding husband, who actually wishes for a woman who is totally mute, one who does not even play the piano, tells her the piano can't be taken with them on their long trek to the house because it is too heavy for the Maori laborers to carry, and he refuses to return for it at a later date. Also at the beach, watching these precedings, is a coarse-looking white man gone native, tattooing his face Maori style, saying nothing about what he sees taking place. The name of this ex-whaler now laborer, is Baines (Keitel). The illiterate Baines is overtaken with joy, after hearing Ada play the piano when she returned to the beach. She is despondent about her marriage and refuses to offer her shy husband any affection, and thusly plays her heart out in the only way she knows how to communicate her feelings. Baines, thereby, decides to make a deal with Stewart for the piano, offering him some land for it, if he can also receive piano lessons from his wife. When the lessons begin, he tells Ada that he wants to receive sexual favors from her. He starts off slowly, by lifting up her skirt when she plays, and will eventually take her into his bedroom. In return, after a series of such sexual encounters, adding up to the number of black keys there are, the piano will go back to her. That makes the relationship that develops between the two seem devilishly strange. These scenes are very powerful and surprisingly enough come across as being sensual, even if, the proposal as put-forth, at first, seemed to be an obvious power-play against a hapless victim. But Campion knows how to draw out the passions from these scenes and make this unlikely romance between these opposites bloom. It all seems plausible because their physical wants are motivating them to act this way toward each other. In the beginning, she pretends to be repulsed by him, but eventually she warms up to him, in fact, she looks forward to the lessons. She does all the playing while he listens, as the music gives off the vibes she wants to communicate. All that he knows, is that he just wants her physically, that he feels her inside his gut; and, that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought possible, is precisely what gives impetus to this Gothic romance. Possibly the most complex character in the story, is the little girl, who is shown to be cute as a button, a seemingly loyal companion of her mother, an able liar, and a bit of a prude. But on the spur of the moment, one day, she fails to follow her mother's orders to deliver a message to Baines- someone her husband has now forbidden her to see- and does something that turns out to be devastating, betraying her mother by impishly delivering the message to Stewart instead of Baines, knowing exactly what she is doing, but somewhat astonished, to her regret, about what tragedy this brings about for her mother. Michael Nyman's astonishing score, performed by Holly Hunter herself, expresses the explosive mood of this extraordinary visionary film. A film whose silence and music speaks for itself as an apt way of communicating. The two men want Ada, even though each of them is not really suited for her, as one represents a cold and frustrated civilized society, while the other is able to express the feelings he has inside himself without being uptight about it, just like the natives of the culture he adopted are able to so easily do. With Stewart, embroiled in jealousy, fighting off his loneliness and repressions, unable to be a warm person and fulfill his marriage duties properly, he is seen as a lost soul, out of his elements in a wild country he can't even begin to fathom. He is stuck in the trap he built for himself, struggling to work the land and tame his restless soul. Sam Neill is stupendous as the lost soul wrestling with his passions. Harvey Keitel, masking a NYC accent by talking in some kind of Maori pigeon tongue, is ably cast as the brooding lover who turns out to have a gentle soul, something this loner must have felt in his heart for a long time but now emerges inside him and gives the film a certain kind of raw power to it. Anna Paquin, in my opinion, is the best surprise in the film, the one with the most difficult role, and the one with the biggest part in the film. What makes it all the more amazing is that she is a mere child, asked to play a part on equal footing with all the accomplished actors she is surrounded by. Holly Hunter, with a gaunt ash-striken face, is mesmorizing in a role that she emotionally is in perfect harmony with. Her performance is the key one; it is the one that propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love. She is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found in this backward place and the passion she feels from Baines, as it seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her. The film is brought slowly together by Jane Campion's masterful direction, whose understanding of the erotic desires of the characters is right on the mark, with the result being an original and haunting film, a story that grew more intensively disturbing for me the longer I thought about it. Stuart Dryburgh's camera captures the internal mood of the characters, as well as the monotonous beauty and the oppressive reality of the countryside. But the film misses the mark, at times, as the two main characters, Stewart and Baines, despite their fine performances, are nevertheless too one-dimensional to give the film more of an impact. It seems as if this is Ada's story to tell and no one else's. This is a film, nevertheless, that will justifiably garner great interest because of her very trying performance.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Saw THE PIANO (***) on Friday night. If you thought how wonderful it would be living in New Zealand a hundred years ago, this movie will disabuse you of that notion. This is a dark and depressing show about the evils of life. Depressing shows can be quite rewarding as this film proves. Holly Hunter without her Southern or any accent (she does not talk) nevertheless gives an award winning performance. She is one of my favorite actresses. Her best for me will always be BROADCAST NEWS. Sam Neill is very good as a husband with an IQ about equal to his age. He was mean yet somehow you managed to feel sorry for him at times because he just did not seem to have the brains to know better. Harvey Keitel was excellent as the, well, as the boy friend I guess you might say. I wish they had ended the show in a slightly different way a few minutes before it actually ended. If you see the show, you will know where I mean. Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Starring Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and Anna Paquin Written and Directed by Jane Campion I wanted to wait until after the Oscars to review this film, and I am glad that I did. I distinguish between the labels film and movie here with great caution, as this ""piece"" or ""text,"" if you will, was a film, and *not* a movie. JURASSIC PARK was a movie; THE PIANO is a film. Allow me to digress so that I may describe what I believe a film to be and a movie to be (before I get any flames from die-hard JURASSIC fans). A movie is what I would consider to be pure entertainment with little or no artistic content (a la DIE HARD I & II, BACKDRAFT, E. T., etc.). A film is an artistic venture with little or no entertainment content (a la 8-1/2, L'ATALANTE, PERSONA, etc.). These are the two extremes, and as always with film in general, there are gray areas. THE PIANO is what I would consider to be, without a doubt, an attempt to make a film, and not a movie. Now that that's out of the way, on with the review. I mentioned that THE PIANO was an attempt to make a film, and not necessarily a film in itself. These may be just semantics, but I truly believe this film to be an attempt, and nothing more. THE PIANO is a very image-oriented film, filled with symbolism but lacking in overt substance. I found this movie to be a very good-looking movie, but found little else in the story or the characters. I found myself influenced by AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE, a previous Jane Campion film, which, while not making me do cartwheels, was an altogether good film. THE PIANO made me feel like I was being pulled this way and that. I felt like Campion was saying all throughout the writing and making of this film ""Let's try this"" or ""This might be good."" It felt haphazard to me, in that the story didn't seem to go anywhere. It had a beginning, middle, and end. A first, second, and third act. It had a setup, a number of confrontations, and a resolution. Everything a typical Hollywood screenplay would require. But what was the point? The cinematography was breathtaking, the acting was satisfactory, and the images were highly symbolic. But why? Most artistic films don't follow the established ""norm"" of the Hollywood screenplay, mostly because artistic films usually don't have much of a script. This is not to belittle art films. On the contrary, this absence of established norms is what provides for the freedom of expression and individuality; the means by which to make us think in a different perspective. THE PIANO gave me little to think about. Why did a film like this, which leans so heavily towards the artistic side of the medium, choose such a common Hollywood cliche format in which to tell its story? AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE had no big-name Hollywood stars in it, yet carried itself very well. THE PIANO has some relatively strong Hollywood heavyweights (Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter). Why the change? I personally got nothing from Holly Hunter's performance. I thought she was good, but not deserving of an Oscar. Anna Paquin was very cute, but I didn't think she should have gotten the Oscar either (based on merit; I liked that she got to upstage all the other actresses). Harvey Keitel, again, plays a weird individual (the only really ordinary part I have seen him play was in THELMA & LOUISE), and, as always, pulls it off convincingly. Sam Neill is the only ""foreigner"" in this group (to Hollywood, that is, barring Anna Paquin), and was satisfactory at best. But I hate to speak of such good actors in this way, because I don't believe they were given really challenging parts to play. One may argue with me on this point, citing a ""brave performance"" by Holly Hunter, but I believe Campion made a grave mistake in creating this character: she let us into her head. We had a piece of her real character with us throughout the rest of the picture. No amount of acting on any actress's part (including Hunter's) would convince me that I am learning anything new about this person through her sign language; I know she can speak; she doesn't have to use it. I know her real character; everything else becomes a facade. I would have liked it if she expressed herself through facial or more subtle physical expressions (when she is injured [no spoiler attempt intended], the only way I know that she is in great pain is through Anna Paquin and through Harvey Keitel, and through other unmentionable things (if I'm not to spoil the film); Hunter showed me nothing, which led me to think that anyone could have played that part). I believe I can recognize good use of subtlety to make a point, a la HOWARD'S END, but even that fine film made me wonder what the point of all this was. Symbolism abounds in this film, which threw me from the telling of the story. Then the story kicked in, which threw me from the appreciation of the images. Torn between two places. What exactly was going on here? Images of death and rebirth in this film are well-known to the artistically inclined; maybe they were ""neato"" things to the Academy and they awarded THE PIANO its share of Oscars based on that. Unfortunately, the Academy always awards based on politics, popularity, and career longevity. Never, if ever, on merit. Anna Paquin is cute, Holly Hunter was due again, and everybody in the Academy seemed to be taken aback by the screenplay to THE PIANO. These are the only reasons I can think of to award Oscars to the categories they did. If they awarded on pure merit, I think the Academy would have been confused with this film. I unfortunately did not have the opportunity to know the artist's intentions beforehand (it's usually easier to review a film based on the intentions of its creator), so all I can do is raise questions. ""What was the point"" is not meant as a harsh indictment of THE PIANO; it is simply a question. Even artistic films have a point!

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Starring: Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, Anna Paquin. Screenplay/Director: Jane Campion. A couple of months ago, I finally saw Jane Campion's 1991 film AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE. I mention this only because I experienced a very similar reaction to THE PIANO as I did to that film. While I was not instantly caught up in the story, its impact grew slowly, and in fact it was not until a couple of days later that I realized what a powerful work I had experienced. THE PIANO is a bit less consistent than AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE, but it is nevertheless an astonishingly literate work, and a further step in the development of a major filmmaker. Set in 19th Century New Zealand, THE PIANO tells the story of Ada, a Scotswoman who hasn't spoken since she was six years old. At the insistence of her father, Ada becomes a mail-order bride for Stewart, a stolid settler among New Zealand's native Maori. Ada brings with her a young daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin), and her most prized possession, a piano. However, when Stewart arrives at the beach where Ada and her belongings have been deposited, he orders the piano left behind. It comes into the possession of George Baines (Harvey Keitel), a rough and illiterate laborer. He offers Ada the chance to win back her piano in exchange for some very specialized lessons, lessons which will lead to a strange and dangerous romantic triangle. THE PIANO is so rich and multi-layered that it virtually defies immediate reaction. At its heart is a story of socially repressed desires which calls to mind THE AGE OF INNOCENCE and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, but this film strengthens that theme by thrusting its characters into an untamed setting. In Ada, we are presented with a character whose muteness represents the restrictions placed on her expression as a woman, and who can only truly speak through her music. It is only when she finds herself in the less constrained world of the New Zealand wilderness, and encounters a man who identifies with the more naturalistic beliefs of the Maori, that she is able to rediscover some semblance of her own voice. THE PIANO is filled with images of culture in conflict: Stewart perplexed by his inability to purchase sacred Maori land for what he considers a fair price; a comical misunderstanding during a melodramatic play; Stewart's outrage at Flora joining Maori children in sexually suggestive behavior. This conflict lends added texture to Stewart's attempt to lock Ada into their house, and the perplexed reaction of his housemaids. Stewart is not trying to keep the Maori out, but trying to prevent Ada from embracing their world. As intricate as the script is, it is the intensity of the lead performances which gives THE PIANO most of its power. Holly Hunter has been trumpeted since Cannes as an Oscar front-runner, and it's easy to see why. It's impossible to describe how expressive she manages to be, in her face and with her body. The literally breath-taking effect of THE PIANO's climactic scene is exponentially multiplied by Hunter's slow, lingering reaction. Baines' role is less fully explained, a bit too typological, but Keitel shows a surprising gentleness. I may have been most impressed by Sam Neill, freed from the straitjacket of JURASSIC PARK to do some splendid acting. His tormented personality is riveting, and the scenes where he is driven to action ripple with sublimated and misdirected passion. THE PIANO's only real stumble is the decision to begin and end the film with a voiceover narration of Ada's thoughts. Hunter's attempt at a Scotch accent is shaky, and it detracts somehow from the experience to be allowed inside Ada's head. Otherwise, Campion crafts a stunning film. Stuart Dryburgh's dynamic cinematography helps capture the power of coastline and forest, and Campion's voyeuristic camera placement is thrilling. It's no longer sufficient or appropriate to refer to Jane Campion as one of the best woman director's working; she is simply one of the best directors, and THE PIANO is one of the most haunting films of the year.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Do not trust me on this one. I am not someone who gets a whole lot out of stories of people who do strange illogical things in the heat of passion. I tend to find these tales comic at just the moment that they are trying to be the most serious. I have this nasty tendency to chuckle at D. H. Lawrence stories. But for me, THE PIANO was an incredibly overwrought and pretentious melodrama. When I should have been shuddering I found myself chortling. The critics who are liking this film so much clearly are better able to appreciate this sort of story. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a woman who has chosen at an early age to remain mute for reasons that even she does not understand. Already we can see that Ada gets caught up in situations where she does not understand her own behavior and motives. Rather than a voice she has come to express herself through music on her piano and through sign language. As the story opens, some time in the 19th Century, she has a daughter of about eight (Ana Paquin) and her father has arranged a marriage between her and a New Zealand settler Stewart (Sam Neill). On her arrival in New Zealand her husband decides that her piano is wrong for life in New Zealand. For practical reasons, though also insensitively, he abandons it on the beach. But without a care for the wishes of his new wife he does not go back for the piano even when he has a chance. Ada goes to a crude neighbor, George Baines (Harvey Keitel) to ask him to rescue the instrument. That he does but convinces Stewart to trade to him the piano for a piece of land. Stewart agrees without even consulting Ada. He knows how much the piano means to her, but after all he is a man and so is insensitive to the wishes of the wife whose affection he is trying to win. Baines is extremely lonely and he finds seeing and hearing Ada play extremely erotic. He first works a deal for Ada to teach him to play the piano as part of the land agreement. But as a side arrangement he tells Ada she can buy back the piano, a black key at a time if she will give him little sexual favors while she plays. This arrangement sets into motion a melodrama of sex and violence worthy of a drive-in triple feature of exploitation films. Perhaps writer/director Jane Campion has made this film with a modicum more polish, but the material is no less trashy than if the story were set on an Arkansas sawmill. Keitel, Hunter, and Neill are all good actors but of them only Keitel manages to rise above the material and invest his character with real humanity. At his worst Baines is never far from being a sympathetic character. It is a bit too easy to feel sorry for poor Ada as the powerless victim. But still her character is top-heavy with too many weird facets for even Hunter to make believable. (Are there genuinely people who not only sleepwalk but sleep-piano-play?) Ada brings about the climax of the story of her and Stewart in an enigmatic act of piano mutilation that was disastrously unsuccessful, but which would have been no less a fiasco had it gone as she planned. Somebody would have noticed the effect on the piano soon. In addition the act seemed to involve a note to someone whom she already knew was illiterate. At least the film is well-photographed, showing both positive and negative aspects of life among the Maori of New Zealand in the last century. That adds what watchable elements the film has. But I cannot help feeling that in years to come, once we are past the initial rush of political sympathy, this film is going to be considered an embarrassment in just the same way BILLY JACK has been. I give this film a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale. For me, this is the most over-rated film of the year. Sorry, I fully expect that there will be many who disagree, but Harvey Keitel and the Emperor are dressed just alike.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Time: sometime in the nineteenth century. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a beautiful and talented pianist. She has a mighty will and, it seems, has refused to speak since childhood. Probably on account of her having an illegitimate daughter (Flora, played by Anna Paquin) she is still unmarried, until her father finds Stewart (Sam Neill), a landowner in New Zealand, who is willing to marry her (English women being scarce in that colony). The film opens with Ada's ""inner voice"" (we don't hear her speak out loud during the film) narrating the above and then we cut to a lonely New Zealand shore with men struggling through the surf to unload Ada, her possessions, and her beloved piano (Ada's only means of expressing herself). Stewart comes to collect her, but does not realise how important the piano is to Ada, and she is unable to tell him. It is left, half-uncrated, on the beach. Ada has trouble coping with the damp and the mud of the settlement where Stewart lives. She demands her piano and sulks when she is told that she is not in Scotland anymore and that there are more important things than music. Another landowner, Baines (Harvey Keitel) sees Ada and is smitten by her. Knowning how important the piano is to her, he fetches it from the beach and offers it to her in return (at first) for letting him watch her play, and (later) for sexual favours. Improbably, she falls in love with him, and inevitable tragedy follows. Director Jane Campion has said of the film (I'm quoting from memory): ""These people don't have twentieth century sensibilities about sex; they aren't prepared for its raw power"". Certainly the behaviour of the characters is strange from a modern perspective--Baines' lust for Ada is easy to understand, but why Ada's for him? I think the film may be rooted in Nineteenth Century Romantic sensibilities more than Campion would care to admit--Ada and Baines are supposed, I think, to be fey and wayward people (Ada talks about being ruled by a powerful Will and her music is completely alien to the characters in the film other than Baines; Baines seems to have attempted to go native; certainly he wears Maori tattooing) thrown together by an exotic and dreamlike setting. In the light of this, the ending in which they find comfortable domesticity is completely unconvincing--the briefly considered tragic alternative ending in which she kills herself is the much more emotionally convincing of the two. I guess it isn't what audiences want to see these days. The best part of the film, for me, was the music--Michael Nyman's hypnotic, romantic, slightly naive piano melodies have to carry much of the responsibility for conveying Ada's character, but I think he succeeds magnificently.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"In THE PIANO, Jane Campion transports the audience to another world and time immediately and with absolute precision. The gray of her New Zealand sea and sky is grayer, grander, more forbidding than our experience of it elsewhere. The stark image of the piano standing in the swirling surf will endure. Next to the piano, waiting, sit Ada and her nine-year-old daughter, Flora, an arranged family for Stewart, a lonely Englishman working his land among the Maori in the New Zealand bush of the 19th century. Borne through the surf by canoes from their ship, they spend the night under the hoop of her skirt, half a world away from their native Scotland and without a notion of what may await them. What awaits them is Stewart who arrives with a band of Maori bearers and his roughly silent neighbor, Baines. The piano is too heavy, Stewart says. It will stay on the beach. Ada, who hasn't spoken a word since she was six, still manages to let the intractable Stewart know her rage. Silence is no indicator of this woman's power. It is Baines who rescues the piano, Ada's voice for all she feels. It is in this, possibly the film's most memorable scene, that Campion begins to pose implied questions that she leaves unanswered. She shrouds the emotions of her characters in mystery. Campion has the eye of a visionary and the singular skill to capture what she sees. The seriousness of the film is punctuated with a wit that flows from her camera, not her words. Ada can earn her piano back, Baines tells her, by coming to his house to give him lessons. One visit for every key, he says; only the black keys, she replies. And so this improbable pair explores the passion unleashed in both of them while Stewart stands by, submerged in emotion he has never felt before. This is an extraordinary exploration of passion and betrayal as it explodes in the remote bush, removed from the eyes of conventional society, but judged with brutal intensity by the players themselves. The cast is beyond praise in conveying Campion's vision of a woman who speaks through her music to the two men who want her. Without words to distract us, we inhabit Ada's soul. Holly Hunter gives an achingly original performance as Ada, playing Michael Nyman's music herself as naturally as if she were speaking. Sam Neill is superb as the vulnerable Stewart who loses his protective covering, and Harvey Keitel brings startling sensitivity to the solitary, innocent Baines. Jane Campion pulled her company into her vision, took them off to the New Zealand bush and with their wise collaboration, captured it on film. The actors seem, as much as the characters they play, a group caught in time and place and passion. In perfect harmony with their director, they draw the audience into their strikingly beautiful and disturbing film so thoroughly that an entire audience sits numbed as the final credits roll.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"Last decade of this dying century was rather harsh for many people who used to live in my part of the world, especially if those people were civic-minded intellectuals or technocrats. For them, it was natural to seek happiness somewhere else and one spot on the other side of the globe became very popular. New Zealand, with its nice climate, thriving economy and plenty of job opportunities, became sort of promised land for many people who wanted to improve their life. Perhaps some of them would change their mind and not see New Zealand as paradise on Earth after watching PIANO, Award-winning 1993 melodrama by Jane Campion. The heroine of the film, set in 1852, is Ada (played by Holly Hunter), beautiful woman who was sent from Scotland in order to be wed to Stewart (Sam Neill), New Zealand colonist and wealthy landowner. With her, Ada to the cold, rainy and muddy colony brings her 9-year (presumably illegitimate) daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and huge piano. For Ada, piano is very important, because since the age of 6 she refused to speak and the music is her only form of expression. However, Stewart doesn't see the importance of the piano for his bride, and he leaves her instrument on the beech. Bains (Harvey Keitel), Stewart's neighbour, rough, illiterate man who had adopted Maori ways, falls in love with Ada and realises how important piano is for her. So he trades gives some land to Stewart in exchange for piano, and later arranges for Ada to give him piano lessons. He than offers her to get her piano back, in exchange for sexual favours. Ada complies, but soon Stewart finds the truth and all leads to dramatic and violent finale. In its time, THE PIANO was a film adored by critics, and it is very easy to explain why. Superb cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh with its use of blue and grey tones gives a right, depressive tone of the film, with very good contrast provided by warmer colours during the love scenes. Costumes by Janet Patterson give the right period feel. Finally, acting is excellent. Holly Hunter deserved her ""Oscar"", no matter how her role of a cripple looked like standard Academy choice for best performance. Anna Paquin, who, by receiving the golden statuette with the age of 9, broke record for youngest Award winner, is also very good, although overshadowed by her better and more experience co-worker. But the true gem of the film is Harvey Keitel, who spares no effort in order to portray the complex and transforming character of Bains as realistically as possible. Sam Neill, who got the thankless role of a husband, hardly can do anything to match their talent. Finally, the entire feel of the film is provided by an excellent musical score by Michael Nyman, one of the best and most memorable in the recent decade. Unfortunately, having many good or excellent doesn't mean that the movie must be good or excellent as a whole. In case of THE PIANO, it happened most probably because the writer and director Jane Campion had the right ideas in her ""Oscar""-awarded screenplay, but lacked the ability to make it understandable to the audience. This story was very romantic in nature, displaying the conflict between the individual and conformist society, and even more universal one, conflict between passion and reason. However, for me, this film was actually done great disservice with the overkill of feminism (quite understandable, because the film was made during the peak of Political Correctness era), and by making the character of Ada too bizarre and unbelievable. Also, the character of Flora could have easily been left out of picture. Jane Campion makes confusion even greater with some bad editing during the film, and by some sudden and gratuitous violence and pointless, although visually impressive finale that lacks any emotional catharsis, at least when the author of this review is concerned. Many of those flaws would be easier to tolerate if Campion had worked a little bit harder to make this film pleasing to the eye. Her naturalistic approach only made those flaws more obvious. Despite that, THE PIANO is still good film to watch, but only if we can stop thinking that it should have been much better.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"**1/2 (out of 4 = OK) 1993, R, 121 minutes [2 hours, 1 minute] [drama] starring: Holly Hunter (Ada), Harvey Kietel (Baines), Sam Neill (Stewart), Anna Paquin (Flora), produced by Jan Chapman, written and directed by Jane Campion. ""The Piano"" is a good movie but not a great movie. Taking into consideration the elements that make up this film, it's not much more than a Victorian soap opera, full of passion, seduction, sex, and violence. It's interesting and well acted, but the elements that make it up and push it along aren't anything special. The setting is 18th Century New Zealand with Holly Hunter starring as Ada, a pale but beautiful widow who has been arranged to marry someone she has never seen in a country she has never been to. She also brings along her daughter Flora (Paquin), who provides for some of the film's best moments. Ada cannot talk, she speaks through sign language and by playing her piano. But Stewart (Neill), her new husband, won't let her bring it into the house. The piano is the major plot element and metaphor for just about everyone and everything in this film. It shows how music reflects and defines mood and attitude. When Ada is happy she plays a flowing, beautiful song, and when she is angry she slams the keys and hits the deep notes. Stewart is a shy and withdrawn man, he is not cruel, but he just doesn't know how to handle the situation. His co-worker Baines (Keitel) is the typical brute with a heart of gold, he can't read but he does understand what art and beauty are. When he hears Ada's piano he adores the music and buys it from Stewart and agrees to sell it back to Ada one key at a time if she teaches him how to play. As Ada tries to play for Baines, he keeps making sexual demands. This element is definitely erotic because of what it doesn't show, as it is an era when woman wore layers of clothes - just getting one layer off would excite a man. This is the kind of passion we don't usually get to see, and Campion films with careful craftsmanship and detail. The way that Hunter portrays this character, it doesn't seem like Ada likes Baines. She is just using him to get her piano back, so they're both being shallow. But when she does get it back, she throws herself at him and they make love. I was totally confused, it seemed like she hated him, now she loves him? Then the story becomes a glamorous soap opera as Stewart finds out about Ada and Baines and spies on them. He chops off one of Ada's fingers and sends it to Baines via Flora. The ending is predictable and not very appealing. Overall, ""The Piano"" was somewhat enjoyable, very well acted, but much too eloquent in its attitude.

"Piano, The",Documentary,2018,"THE PIANO is a film about passion, the most basic and primal element of human nature. No matter how thick the veneer of civilization is, or how deeply-buried beneath layers of social repression those latent emotions are, passion ultimately cannot be denied. This is something that the three principals of this movie learn in various, not-always-pleasant, ways. In the mid-1800s, Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives on the stormy shores of New Zeland, a mute bride sold by her father to a British emigrant named Stewart (Sam Neill). In addition to a normal assortment of baggage, Ada brings with her eight-year old Flora (Anna Paquin), her illegitimate daughter, and a piano. Initially, Stewart declares that the piano is too bulky to move from the beach, and resists bringing it to his house despite Ada's wordless pleadings. Next, he sells it to fellow Englishman Baines (Harvey Keitel), a man who has embraced the local Maori ways. In addition to the piano, Baines wants a reluctant Ada as his teacher. When he offers her a deal to get the instrument back, she is unprepared for the price she must ultimately pay. THE PIANO has powerful emotional themes resonating through it, all dealing with the release of repressed passion. Baines, who has embraced the native Maori methods of living, no longer clings to the values of British society, and is therefore quite capable of expressing himself freely--which he does, albeit in some strange ways. Stewart, however, views the Maori with suspicion and hostility and, in clinging to the tenants of English society, refuses to allow himself to feel until one violent moment when everything comes pouring out. Ada, hampered as much by her lack of voice as by social pressures, is yearning to break free, and only through Baines does she find the courage to do so. Jane Campion's story is often stirring and occasionally gut-wrenching; the latter perhaps to a fault. There is a single visceral scene in this movie which becomes the most stark and enduring image taken from the theater. While definitely an expression of passion, this is perhaps not intended as the single defining moment of THE PIANO, although it may be remembered as such. Symbolism abounds, and most of it is clear enough for even the casual viewer to grasp. Ada's piano is obviously more than a source of music - it is her voice; her only means of expressing herself. The Maori society is representative of released inhibitions. Stewart's rejection of this, like Baines' acceptance, defines the basis of who he is. The final scenes of THE PIANO abound with symbols, the recognition of which will help in understanding all the facets of the ending. The three main actors give dazzling performances. Everything previously written about Holly Hunter is true. To be able to convey this much energy and emotion without ever speaking a word (except in a pair of short voiceovers) requires someone of astonishing talent and ability. Hunter's Ada is every bit as powerful a presentation as Anthony Hopkins' Stevens in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. Harvey Keitel is as good, although the complexities of his character don't allow for quite as obvious a standout performance. Sam Neill has the most incomplete material to work from, but he does all he can with Stewart. Like their adult counterparts, child actors come with varying ranges of ability. Anna Paquin is one of those who shows capabilities far beyond her years. While not in the category of a Valentina Scalici (from IL LADRO DI BAMBINI, and who I have stated is the best child performer I have ever seen), Ms. Paquin is ultimately believable in her role, and a great asset to the film. She compliments the main trio effectively. As good as Ms. Campion's basic story is, both characterization and technical presentation are lacking. Taken in tandem, these flaws prevent THE PIANO from attaining its full potential. While Ada is as fully-rounded as she can be, the others all have elements missing from their personalities. Stewart never attains three-dimensionality, despite Sam Neill's best attempts, and Baines is occasionally little more than a sounding board for Ada's emotions to reverberate off of. Flora's personality undergoes a radical shift that, at best, is only partially-motivated by what we see on screen. The editing of THE PIANO is choppy, at times causing the narrative to seem disjointed or confusing. More than one transition is jarringly abrupt. There were several instances when my connection with the film was broken because of this. It's odd that, with a name like THE PIANO, one of the weaknesses is the score. There are instances when Michael Nyman's themes are inappropriate for the scenes where they are used, and it has been pointed out to me that the New Age strains coming from Ada's instrument have no place during the time period in which THE PIANO is supposed to have taken place. THE PIANO is a good film with a potent message and occasional splashes of genius, but it is not remarkable experience, except perhaps where Holly Hunter's performance is concerned. While it's true that individuals will attribute different importance to the various flaws, there exists the distinct possibility that those going to see THE PIANO with the expectation of watching the best movie of the year, will leave the theater disappointed. - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Hype is a term usually associated with a highly anticipated big-budget film, and it exists to spark interest so that the studios can make lots of money. Too much hype almost always leads to a letdown, as proven with ""Godzilla"" and ""Wild Wild West"". But ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a ""victim"" of a different kind of hype. A hit at Sundance, ""Blair Witch"" was hyped because of its critical praise and its unconventional premise. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a fictional film about 3 twenty-something filmmakers who head off into Maryland's Black Hills to film a documentary on a local myth called the ""Blair Witch"". The three never return(as we're informed at the beginning), but the footage which they have filmed has turned into this movie. The first few minutes of the film are comedic as the filmmakers ask the locals whether they believe the myth or not. Then, as they begin their hike into the woods, they begin to notice strange things. The high-strung Heather is holding the camera, filming basically everything that she, Michael and Josh do. What started off as a documentary about the fiction of myths has turned into an exercise in paranoia. I don't want to give away much plot, because the thrill of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not knowing what is going to happen. Filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have created one of the creepiest and most original horror flicks of all-time. Heavily hyped on the internet, many who see this film believe that it is totally real. But if you see the film knowing the truth, then you will notice the incredible wonder of the entire project. Shot on a miniscule $100,000 budget, ""The Blair Witch Project"" used its limited resources to make an incredibly creative thriller that relies on smarts instead of effects to shock the viewers out of their seats. The filmmakers sent the three actors into the woods with cameras and an understanding of the film's premise. They spent a week hiking from spot to spot, and then picked up food and film. It was up to them to improvise and film their scenes. The result is shot on poor 16mm and Hi8 video with a couple of handheld cameras. ""The Blair Witch Project"" has been breaking all kinds of box-office records in its first week in limited release. Destined to be a cult-classic, it proves that a low-budget can spark surreal creativity, and that psychological paranoia is much scarier than costly aliens. ""Blair Witch"" reinvents the horror genre moreso than ""Scream"" supposedly did. I'm glad that smarts and great marketing are adding up to dollars for Artisan Entertainment, which is currently the boldest name in independent cinema. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is far from perfect, but it is a piece of landmark filmmaking. a review by Akiva Gottlieb, The Teenage Movie Critic akiva@excite.com http://teenagemoviecritic.8m.com Get FREE voicemail, fax and email at http://voicemail.excite.com Talk online at http://voicechat.excite.com The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"In 1994, three young and inexperienced documentary film-makers set off into the Maryland woods to investigate the story of the Blair Witch, a creepy figure of local folklore, said to be responsible for disappearances and deaths over several decades. All that was ever found of them was the footage they shot. This material was edited and the result is presented here. It tells the remarkable story of how they became lost in the forest and were tormented by strange unseen forces. There's one often-overlooked aspect of this spooky tale that's worth bearing in mind... it's not true. Let's just let that sink in a moment. It's a story. They made it up. It didn't happen. Some low-budget films have a structure or technical approach which flows from a single cost-cutting idea. The excellent 1998 Canadian science fiction film Cube was set in a huge maze of interconnecting cubic rooms. A set was constructed of one such room, 18 feet on a side, and that's where the whole film was shot. The Blair Witch Project takes a similarly simple and retrospectively obvious idea to make a virtue of necessity: the whole film is presented as the edited footage shot by the three documentary makers and all this material was recorded by the three actors playing the documentary crew. The actors were given a 16mm film camera, a Hi-8 video camera and sound recording equipment, and each day they were given some minimal direction and left to improvise a day's shooting. The footage was collected at the end of each day in exchange for food and the next day's story line. The real film-makers crept around the actors' tent at night producing scary noises and preparing strange artifacts for the increasingly uncomfortable cast to discover the next day. The originality of this idea has been questioned, with films such as Cannibal Holocaust and The Last Broadcast cited as earlier examples of the mockumentary approach to horror movies. The nature of the film lends itself to confusion about the reality of the events depicted. When we see tired, hungry, cold and scared characters on the screen, we are watching actors, but we are watching tired, hungry, cold and scared actors. Many people seem to have had a problem grasping the idea that the film is a work of fiction. Feeding off the pre-millennial appetite for spooks and demons, the film-makers deliberately fostered this confusion by using the actors' names - Heather, Michael and Josh - for the characters and presenting the film as a true story in promotional material. The official web site, for example, provides extensive ""factual"" background material on the (completely made-up) Blair Witch story and the unfortunate trio. The story is also presented as truth in many of the unofficial web sites which fuelled interest in the film. These sites were supposedly produced by fans of the movie, but it has been suggested, although the film- makers deny it, that some were actually professionally-produced publicity sites masquerading as fan sites. There is no violence or gore in the film (apart from a small lump of unidentifiable bloody matter), no special effects and no visible monsters or spooks - the story is told purely through the reactions of Heather, Michael and Josh to what goes on around them. The three performances are convincing, but it is hard to know to what extent we are watching acting or a recording of three very uncomfortable people. The story goes that the actors had to sign releases indicating that they would not hold the film-makers liable for any psychological damage they might suffer as a result of the harsh shooting conditions. In order to see the performances, of course, the characters had to film each other when they might have been expected to have more important things to do, such as make their documentary, find their way out the woods, or run around screaming. This is explained by the pushy Heather, who does much of the most personally intrusive filming and claims to want to record their experiences as well as make a documentary. I wasn't really convinced by this explanation, but how else could we have a movie to watch? The film has so far made around $140,000,000 in the US - not bad for a movie that cost around $40,000 to make (although the distribution company that picked it up spent an extra $100,000 on the film, mainly on improving the sound quality). It is hard to know what the film's writer- directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez can do next. They have made one of the most successful films of all time, and the money people will be throwing cash at them, yet they've made an unrepeatable freak of a film, with no evidence that they will have a clue about how to make another movie. The Blair Witch Project is a triumph of marketing, and raises some interesting issues about what's real and what isn't in movies. The technical approach is novel, but this in itself isn't enough to sustain a feature film. There are a few creepy moments, and a the final scene is pretty chilling, but the scariest film ever made? Hardly. When the making and marketing of a film is more interesting than the film itself, you know there's something wrong. -- Gary Jones Homepage: www.bohr.demon.co.uk PGP public key available from servers (DH/DSS key ID: 0x11EAE903) The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"My goodness, this little picture has become such an event, hasn't it? The film itself (without the chatter) wouldn't be much more than a video teens might think pretty cool. However, everyone is talking about this film; the gardener, the taxi driver -- I just discussed it with a semi-retired notary in San Louis. Unless you're one of those weird, remote, or way-married folks who never see movies anymore -- you've heard the hype. Admittedly, I wouldn't have seen it without the popularity, without the lines of people outside the theaters. Alas, my ever-growing curiosity could no longer remain in the dark. What it appears to be: The picture is about a film crew of three young people (Josh, Mike and Heather) with the mission of documenting the legend of Blair Witch. Supposedly, in 1940 seven children were killed up in the back woods of New England and since then the older generation has always spoken of hauntings. The preface (in text) tells us that this documentary trio disappeared and that we're about to see the film and video tape that they left behind. The first twenty minutes are spent in nearby towns interviewing a few people concerning their knowledge of the myth and whether or not they buy into it. But much of the footage holds behind the scenes glimpses of the young trio as they think and talk about their mission. It's reminiscent of MTV's ""Real World."" The remainder of the film is shot with no other subjects beyond these three crew members in no other location than in the woods. No witch is ever filmed. In short, there's a lot of shaky camera movement, hiking, arguing about map interpretation, and spooky noises in a dark tent during the four or five nights. Heather is the director and project leader, she drives the crew. It appears to me that she is in on the hoax. The other two actors seem to be truly bewildered and increasingly ""freaked out"" by what appear to be ""the real"" filmmakers (or producers, or friends of Heather) out in the woods making cackling noises, ruffling the tent mesh, and leaving creepy patterns of stones and sticks. Though I must say, Heather's cracking voice and red-eyed tears often had me reconsidering my assumption. Did I say ""hoax""? Perhaps hoax is too strong a word. Anyway, what's really happening is... before the shoot, ""real"" directors Myrick and Sanchez provided their three person mock-documentary crew a 35 page outline, a crash course on 16 mm film and Hi-8 video photography, and daily clues left in a box. From there, ""BWP"" is three rattled actors doing a fine job of ad-libbing. Whether or not the actors where informed that they'd be harassed at night, I don't know. Either way ... Myrick and Sanchez were getting heated drama during the day and truly animalistic fear-filled utterances from them in the dark. Technically speaking: The little film is shot mostly on video tape and 16mm film, both of which are not considered acceptable formats for the big screen under normal circumstances. However this is not a normal situation. I have high praise (and envy) for the conception of the ""Blair Witch Project."" The filmmakers took a great idea, lied a little, and made a motion picture out of a bunch of sticks and very little money. I'm sure they'll have secured themselves a nice budget for their next production. (FYI: DAT is Digital Audio Tape. The three often worry about getting the DAT back. Which means ... they'd probably rented sound recording equipment and needed to return it promptly or pay penalty fees etc.) Entertainment value: Oddly I found most of the production rather interesting -- though nothing terribly scary till the end, which was more of a spooky cub-scout-camp-story scary than really horrific. I enjoyed the drama between the three. I wanted to see just how long Heather could keep these guys from beating the crap out of her or taking off on their own. The sometimes extremely heated arguments (usually between Heather and either one of the guys) did get tiresome. That and the video was very jittery at times -- beyond what was necessary to create the sense of nervousness I'm sure they wanted. I had to intermittently look away from the screen to prevent a headache. Ultimately, the movie was better than I'd anticipated, a curiously unique endeavor on it's own (which I'm reviewing) and plainly outstanding as the event that it's become.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project Starring: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard 82 Minutes Long, Rated R for strong language A great film that has you captivated the whole way through for one of the most haunting endings in the horror film genre. The horror film genre has always been depleted. Since Hitchcock, we have never seen a steady stream of truly scary films. However, the horror film genre has been resurrected in the 90s, but to no avail. Scream gave viewers a spook or two, I Know What You Did Las Summer was just a teen vehicle, and the latest, The Haunting, is a special effects masterpiece that forgets that its purpose is to scare us, not have us in awe of the beauty of the house. But, we have a true horror film in our midst right now. The Blair Witch Project. It is not a scarefest from start to finish, but as you shall see in this review, it gets us to believe and then pulls out the horror. This film was made for forty thousand dollars. You probably could have only filmed two minutes of The Haunting with that budget. But, after seeing this film, we need to be constantly reminded that money cannot buy depth in a motion picture. Does this film look like it was made with forty thousand dollars? No, it looks like it used even less. But, this is the bait. And once you believe that they are stranded in the woods, and once you believe that there might be something out there with them, they pull you in. Hook, line and sinker. The cast is wonderful in this film. The only way a horror film can scare you is if they make you believe what is going on. Alfred Hitchcock did that, and that is why he is the king of horror. I am not comparing Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick to Hitchcock, but they did do a great job with their cast. Heather Donahue plays, well, Heather Donahue. Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams also play themselves. I guess forty thousand dollars cannot buy you different names. Or maybe it just added to the realism. Heather Donahue is great. In a present day where leading ladies are hard to come by, Donahue takes the cake. The problem with most women taking leading roles is that they cannot be believable, something this whole film is based on. But, Donahue plays the role in stride. Her character is the one making the documentary, getting help from Williams and Leonard. She is demanding, hard nosed and the leader and I believed it. Michael Williams plays his role terrifically as well. When the film starts, you think he will be the minor character. All he is there for is the sound. Well, think again. He lets his role flourish. As the group of three meshes, his role standouts, which becomes much more important as the film roles on. Joshua Leonard plays the sort of, peace hippie who tries to keep everything under control. Surprisingly, he is the first one to disappear. His role complements the others as well. None of the cast stands out because they all give great performances and they all mesh. Whatever egos they may have had were checked at the door because this cast is about getting the film done, not giving the best performance. This makes their performances even better. The plot is the best part of this film. Despite the great acting and realism, all horror films still need a scary plot. This one is based on three filmmakers who want to make a documentary on the local legend of The Blair Witch. I will not spoil too much, but lets just say that The Blair Witch is a person/creature who supposedly killed children years ago. Then, after interviewing a few locals, they head out into the woods. They start filming in the woods, finding places that are spoken of in the legend. They are disappointed, but still film, looking for more answers. However, they soon find a portion of the woods littered with The Blair Witch ""symbol."" This is where things start to go wrong. They start hearing noises in their sleep; first everyone believes it could be an animal or some sort of prankster. But, as they start to believe it could be The Blair Witch, we start to believe as well. And as things progress, they lose such things as the map and Joshua. That is about as far as I should go, but let me just say that when you see the ending, prepare for a haunting experience. Is there anything wrong with The Blair Witch Project? Yes, but nothing major that holds it back from being a four star film. The only flaws I saw in this film were with two things. Mike kicks their map into the river, claiming it was not getting them anywhere. At this point in the film, they are nowhere near crazy, which is why I do not believe this part. The other flaw is nothing major and actually enhanced the experience for me. But, for those of you who cannot stand shoddy camerawork (i.e. your home movies) then do not see this film. The camera goes everywhere and even has times when the screen is completely black and all you hear are voices. This added to the realism for myself, but might make other people just suffer motion sickness. Overall, this is the best film that I have seen this summer. It has humor in the beginning and then progresses to have you believe the scenario. Then it blows your mind with an innovative and haunting ending. And, ironically, it is a sharp contrast to the effects laden blockbusters that plague us every summer. Fortunately, The Blair Witch Project was made with forty thousand dollars, plus a lot of heart, hard work and creativity. This makes it one of the best films of the summer and of the year.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Starring Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard. Rated R. The Blair Witch Project will go down in the books as one of independent filmmaking's biggest triumphs because of the extent which it has broken through to the mainstream. Not only has it gotten an inordinate amount of unabashedly positive reviews from critics but in its first few weeks of limited release it has also achieved commercial success of gargantuan proportions. Whether this $20,000 project can attain box-office bliss by studio standards remains to be seen, but, if nothing else, it's already a cult hit. Popularity is fine, but is the movie any good? That's unrelated to its Hollywood status and it demands more thoughtful discussion. It's certainly original -- I've never seen anything like it. But does it have any cinematic merit? Is it junky fun or is it a serious movie? This is one of those films, I think, where the answers to all of these questions are solely in the eye of the beholder -- and that's okay. What seemed to me clearly true, however, is that this is no masterpiece of American cinema: it is far too flawed to attain that status even though many fans and even some critics, who have gone off the deep end, insist the opposite. Three student filmmakers -- Heather, Josh and Mike go on a hike into Maryland woods to film a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local urban legend. They disappear. A year later their footage is found. The Blair Witch Project is that footage and nothing but that footage. They film the whole trip, from the interviews they do with people in a Maryland town to the hike. When one of them loses the all-important map they are lost in the middle of nowhere with something mysterious and frightening on their tail. Inevitable tensions escalate within the group. Josh and Mike are furious at Heather for refusing to turn the camera off and and focusing on their dire situation. Heather and Josh are furious at Mike for apparently kicking the map into a creek. Their desperation and refusal to cooperate with each other threatens to destroy them. So, evidently, does the Blair Witch. The Blair Witch Project is constantly creepy and occasionally unnerving but up until the gut-wrenching climax its format prevents it from being genuinely scary and even then it seems to dilute it somewhat. It's a grand idea -- making a movie solely filmed with a hand-held camera by its characters -- but it has its drawbacks. All too often it's slightly hard to tell what's going on because, understandably, the camera doesn't stay steady when the people behind it are in hysterics. It's very difficult to argue that being sure of what's happening is scarier than a menace unknown, which is why something like The Game or the best of Hitchcock's stuff is always more frightening than any slasher movie. Tense anticipation makes the ""boo"" moment anticlimactic. Still, when the viewer is utterly confused (which, luckily, happens only in a few instances here) horror films tend to have less effect. The dialogue, much of it improvised (the directors sent the actors alone into the woods to film the movie), surprisingly comes off as realistic. It's not particularly witty but it seems to resemble what real people would utter in that kind of situation; it never feels fabricated or manipulative. Profanity abounds but hey -- would you expect anything less from three mightily pissed-off young college students? Some will insist that even adequate execution of such brilliantly original idea is enough to make this movie a milestone in cinema; especially horror cinema. I disagree strenuously. It's enjoyable stuff but folks, it's nothing to write home about. The climax approaches terrifying and it contains many suspenseful, well-made sequences but by the same token The Blair Witch Project is inconsistent, confusing and unevenly paced. In a word (three, actually, but never mind): hit and miss. This nifty little film gets off to a slow start (to the extent that is possible in a film running barely over 80 minutes) and drags through some of its first half. But when it's going, it's good. Crafty, visionary and enjoyable, this may not be a masterpiece, but it's a refreshing digression from the pretension that indie filmmaking tends to represent and from the horror movie clichés that make this movie's companions so dull. ©1999 Eugene Novikov‰ Sent via Deja.com http://www.deja.com/ Share what you know.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"When was the last time you were scared by a movie? Keep in mind that I'm not talking about being spooked or startled; I'm talking about being totally and uttering pierced by the sting of fear. The Exorcist? The Shining, perhaps? Sure, Hollywood comes out with dozens of cheap thrills each year, and it doesn't take much speculation to figure out that the true art of horror has been long since swept under the carpet to make way for a genre of teen comedies that disguise themselves as slasher flicks. But rest assured; The Blair Witch Project is the real deal. But the odd thing is, there is nary one special effect or false scare in the whole of the film. Shot mostly on video (giving it a gritty, real-life feeling) for a measly $30,000, Blair Witch embodies all that I love about filmmaking. Making the audience use a little imagination for once, it really is a breath of fresh air. As everyone probably already knows, the films deals with three college filmmakers who travel into the depths of a Maryland forest to document a local legend. Though they are never heard from again, the footage they shot was recovered. The leader of the pack is Heather, the strong-willed film student making the documentary based upon the Blair Witch phenomena of the title. If Heather Donahue isn't at least nominated for an Academy Award for her work here, then I propose a mass boycott of the Oscars. Blending comedy and pathos seamlessly, she has created a truly sympathetic and ultimately tragic figure. The performance of the year, in my opinion, and I will be astounded if one comes along that is half as effective. Joining Heather in her venture into the desolate woods are Josh (Joshua Leonard), the 16mm cameraman, and Mike (Michael C. Williams), acting as soundman. Though not quite as commanding in their roles as Donahue, I dare you to spot a single moment where either of them are acting. Of course, this is no surprise, considering the extremes the actors endured to make their characters as true-to-life as possible. For 10 days, they pretty much experienced what is depicted as fiction in the movie. Apparently, the whole thing was entirely improvised, with notes hidden around the woods to simply give the actors their motivation for the scene. No one can deny that these are three courageous performances. And it all paid off in the end, too. For a micro-budgeted independent film, set forth amidst a slew of obscenely costly ""summer"" movies, The Blair Witch Project has made quite a name for itself. Destined to become the most successful film of all time (in a cost to profit ratio, that is), Blair Witch first caused a stir at last year's Sundance film festival and eventually was sold to an independent studio for a mere $1 million (if the Louisiana Purchase was the best deal in American history, then this has to be the second best). A movie so frightening and completely effective is all too hard to come by. Set the way-back machine to 1990, when John McNaughten's Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer premiered in theaters; audiences and critics alike were taken back by the honesty of such a film, one that broke all the rules and pulled absolutely no punches. Anyone who has seen Henry will no doubt recall the infamous scene where Henry and his partner in crime Otis videotape themselves invading a suburban home and callously killing the family that inhabited it. Remember that nauseating terror? Remember that unflinching honesty? Blair Witch duplicates that same feeling of inner terror and hammers it home for no less than 80 minutes. I realize that may seem like an excessively brisk running time, but I'm not sure I could have taken any more than that. Blair Witch doesn't simply scare you out of your wits; no, it's far to clever for that. It drains you of every conceivable emotion, and afterwards you are left numb. Which, I suppose, brings us to the film's ending. I will say nothing of it narrative-wise (ruining it would be a crime against humanity), but suffice to say that it is the creepiest moment since Norman Bates smiled into the camera at the end of Psycho. Again, no FX, just a profound feeling of shock and - are you ready for this? Brace yourself - sadness. You see, unlike most films of its kind, the characters here function as people first and plot devices second. Right from the opening title card, we know that the characters will not come out of their situation alive. This makes their plight all the more sympathetic. There have been rumors (I'm not sure if anything has been announced officially) that a sequel or prequel may be in the works. Words cannot describe the new level of ineptitude that this notion establishes. What's next, ""Schindler's List: The Babyboomer Years""? Or maybe ""Saving Private Ryan 2: Basic Training""? No, The Blair Witch Project should simply stand alone and not give way to the system. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"It seems to me that critics and audiences have become so tired of the same old kind of movies, that they now turn to anything remotely different and acclaim it as though it were the greatest film ever made. This would seem to be the case with ""The Blair Witch Project"". While certainly innovative, and contains a few genuinely creepy scenes, most of the film seems to revolve around watching three teens bicker out in the woods. Three students set out for a small town in Maryland which is home to a legend, the legend of the Blair Witch. First interviewing the townspeople, they eventually decide to head into the woods to find the site of the Witch's killings. The three travel through the woods for days, becoming lost and eventually turning on each other. The whole time, something in the woods stalks them. Leaving small symbols at first, the stalker becomes more and more bold and eventually openly attacks, dragging one off in the night. It seems that the majority of people feel fully one way or another about this film. Either they think it's one ofthe greatest ever made, or is an utter piece of garbage they can't believe they were dragged to. I, on the other hand, am fairly divided about this movie. As I said earlier, it's a truly innovative film. Shot entirely as though it were lost footage shot with a home camera, it does seem quite realistic. However, if you suffer easily from motion sickness, stay far away. There are also a few scenes which are quite eerie. The two that stick out most in my mind are the conclusion, and a scene where the group stumbles across hundreds of figures made out of sticks in a section of woods. Now, on to the items that really couldn't stand. One thing which I simply can't believe, is that while running terrified through the woods, with some horrible thing chasing them, the kids would actually keep the camera held at eye level! The other major problem was that between nights in the tent, when the creature in the woods harassed the group, they spent the days arguing on and on. I saw some people in the theatre begin to doze off in these scenes. Some truly creepy scenes which are plagued by stretches of boring dialogue earns this movie three stars, and a reccomendation to wait for video (but watch it with the lights off to get the true effect). * * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever made, see it now. * * * * - Great flick. Try and catch this one. * * * - Okay movie, hits and misses. * * - Pretty bad. See it if you've got nothing better to do. * - One of the worst movies ever. See it only if you enjoy pain.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Over the past one hundred years, many movies have been given the moniker, ""horror film,"" but few have deserved it. They were given that title mainly due to their subject matter, but a vampire, werewolf, zombie, ghost, maniac with an ax, demon, or even the Devil himself does not a horror movie make. There have been many a valiant effort. Some even managed to truly scare their audience, but they have sadly fallen short of what a true horror movie is suppose to do. A true horror movie's objective is not to just frighten you, but to upset you; to make you feel uneasy as you are watching, and to make that feeling follow you, even after you have left the theater. It is not supposed to gross you out with gory make-up effects. It is not supposed to amaze you with what can now be put on the screen with state-of-the-art computer effects. It is not supposed to make you feel like you have been on a roller coaster after it is all over. A horror movie is supposed to make you feel like you have been hit in the face with that roller coaster. The ""politically correct"" 90s, where everyone is supposed to feel happy, and you are not supposed to upset anyone, have not been a very good time for ""Hollywood"" horror movies. Not to mention the ones that are suppose to ""rock the boat"" and come right out and slap the audience in the face. So, I was beginning to believe that the 90s were going to be the first decade since the modern horror movie began (the 1920s)that we were not going to have a true horror movie; a classic in the genre. But thankfully, I was wrong. The Blair Witch Project just did make it with less than six months left in the decade, but there it is, standing as an example of what a horror movie should be. Made on a budget of sixty thousand dollars, and by a group of unknowns, TBWP, is well on its way to earning more than one million dollars in only its first month of release. It is setting box office records and has people standing in LONG lines; lines that have not been seen since another horror classic was in theaters, The Exorcist. The back story is simple enough. In 1994, three student film makers went into a wooded area of Maryland to make a documentary about the local legend, the Blair Witch. They never returned. The movie consists of the footage that they shot and that was supposedly found one year after their disappearance. What follows is a movie that succeeds where all other so-called horror movies have failed. It is nearly a textbook on how to make an effective horror film; on how to manipulate your audience; on how to take ordinary places and circumstances and make them terrifying by turning the familiar into something unfamiliar. In a true horor film, it is not the film maker that frightens the audience. They can put in ""surprises"" that make people jump in their seats, but that is not horror. In a horror film that is doing its job, it is the audience that is frightening the audience. Since the entire movie was shot with a video camera and a regular film camera, TBWP. has a ""reality based"" feel to it. People are used to seeing that only on television, not at a movie theater. Then there are only three characters throughout the majority of the film, so you have a very intimate setting and at times you feel like a voyeur. Then since this is all ""amateur"" film making, there is no blaring soundtrack of intrusive, popular songs. There is also no Dolby surround sound, so you are forced to pay attention to dialogue. There are bits of dialogue that you cannot make out, so like the characters you are watching, you are not quite sure just what is going on in some spots. All of this works to pull the audience into the movie and forces them to be a part of it; something modern audiences are not used to and that adds to the feelings of unease that are already brewing because this movie is breaking so many rules. Then, this is not a movie where action scenes are pilled on top of action scenes. When something exciting is going on, the camera movement is jerky and disorienting, and you can't always hear what is being said. Then as if to add a final insult, there are no breathtaking, wowie- zowie special effects. Just trees and raw human emotion. You watch as the three film makers become more lost and frightened and you are forced to observe their slow decent into near madness. A situation that no one is comfortable with. And because you already know that these people never make it out of those woods, you begin to wonder just what IS going to happen to them? What horrible fate awaits them? You find yourself rooting for them, even though you know that they are doomed. Now the movie-going experience is completely out of whack. Characters in a horror movie that you really like and care about? What it all adds up to is that without even noticing it, you have become involved. You are now a participant, be it willing or unwilling. There is now a sort of audience participation going on and that is the key element in any successful horror movie; or any other movie for that matter. By this time, the audience is not really sure what is going to happen next. Some are truly scared because of that very fact; they don't know. To its credit, TBWP is not predictable. Some are mad because they ARE scared and not used to that feeling in a 1990s horror movie; others are mad because this movie is breaking all the rules. Where is all the blood? Where is all the slam-bam action? Where are all the bodies? How dare they. Others are just praying that this whole damn thing will be explained to them at the end. But ALL are riveted to their seats because no one knows where all this is leading. We are all exactly where the movie wants us to be; off balance, tense, and uneasy. We have been manipulated and placed in a situation that many don't want to be in. Some are not even sure how they got there. Then the final trap is sprung and we watch as the final fate of the three characters that we have lived with for the past hour and a half unfolds. Not wishing to give anything away, let's just say that it is an ending that will be written about and discussed in film classes for years to come. But the end credits roll, the house lights come up, and the ordeal is over. The effects of a true horror film last long after the credits have faded from the screen. The images stay with you, they make you take those quick glances over your shoulder as you make your way to your car. Then if you go get something to eat afterwards, what you have just seen is all that you can talk about. On the drive home, it is all you can think about. Then when you are ""safe"" at home and in your bed and the lights go out, you try not to think about what you have just witnessed anymore. But it is no use. All the uneasy feelings refuse to go away. And now that you are in darkness, they are magnified. You are no longer in the relative safety of a crowed movie theater. You are alone, in a state of undress, and laying there wondering if there is something lurking out there in the dark that is surrounding you. Just like the three film makers you had just seen had wondered when they put their lanterns out. You try to tell yourself that conventional wisdom is right, and that there is nothing in the dark but the darkness. But you can't shake the feeling that conventional wisdom just might be wrong. After all, it was wrong in the case of the three young people in The Blair Witch Project. But that was only a movie. Or was it? The Blair Witch Project gets a very much deserved **** and will join films like Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a true horror film.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez With Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard R 87 min You've been dining for weeks on haute cuisine with designer ingredients and frou-frou presentations; suddenly you find yourself munching a roadhouse cheeseburger, and nothing ever tasted so good. This, in essence, is the appeal of the indie thriller phenomenon ""The Blair Witch Project"". To a public sated with the billion-dollar effects of modern cinema tech, there's something irresistible about this bare-bones little horror story, shot on 16mm and high-8 video, without any special effects, on a budget you could carry in your pocket in coins. ""Blair"" is a faux documentary (the hip word is ""mockumentary""; I offer ""crockumentary""). It purports to be footage shot by a trio of student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard) that was discovered a year after they disappeared in the Maryland woods while shooting a documentary about a legendary child-killing witch. Heather, Josh, and Mike start off in high spirits, recording each other in the car and the motel room. They interview locals and explore sites connected to the folklore. Then they head into the woods with backpacks, a map, and a compass in search of an old graveyard. The seem to have plenty of film and an endless appetite for shooting it. But soon they're hopelessly lost, and this is where the creepiness creeps in. Fear comes at them from two angles -- the growing terror of being lost in the woods, and the encroaching horror of the witch lore. They begin to hear things -- real, or hysterical suggestion? They begin to find things -- ominous ritualistic-looking bundles of sticks and piles of stones. Something's out there...is it supernatural, or psychotic? Tempers flare, nerves crack. Things get very, very bad. Then they get worse. Point-of-view is the inspiration that makes this movie click. Everything we see is recorded by the young documentarians on their 16mm b&w production camera and the color camcorder brought by Heather to document her documentary. We're there with them -- there's no omniscient crew, no other reality behind the camera. It's all subjective, hand-held, grainy and jerky. On the upside this provides immediacy; on the downside, it can make you a little nauseous, and you welcome moments when the screen goes black and there's only audio from the DAT recorder. ""Blair"" is a welcome antidote to gore, gadgets, explosions, and computerized excess. But despite the internet-orchestrated hype, it's not the scariest thing you've ever seen. It lives and dies on credibility, and having committed themselves to the first-person camera, the filmmakers find themselves in the awkward position of having to keep the camera rolling when circumstances make it almost impossible to believe.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (Artisan) Starring: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard. Screenplay: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. Producers: Gregg hale and Robin Cowie. Directors: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. MPAA Rating: R (profanity, adult themes, intense situations) Running Time: 86 minutes. Reviewed by Scott Renshaw. The last of the 34 films I screened at Sundance this year was not merely the best film the festival had to offer. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is a work of genre-redefining brilliance, a strong early candidate for the best film of 1999, and one of the most unnerving psychological thrillers ever made. It works on the kind of primal level that will leave you shaking for hours afterwards. It's the kind of film for which festivals like this truly exist. The concept alone is ingenious enough to grab interest (though not utterly unique): an on-screen caption at the beginning of the film announces that three college students disappeared in the Black Hills of Maryland in 1994 while making a documentary film, and that only the footage they shot was ever found. Thus begins a 90-minute, verite-style tale of the three students -- director Heather (Heather Donahue), cameraman Josh (Joshua Leonard) and sound man Mike (Michael Williams) -- and their project to make a film about a local legend. The story goes that mass child murders and other disappearances in the area formerly known as Blair are the work of the ""Blair Witch,"" who lives in the hills above the town. The project leads to a two-day hike for location footage, two days that we watch turn into a seemingly endless nightmare when the trio gets lost and the sounds at night grow ever more disturbing. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT begins with a seductive lightness of tone, as the filmmakers record both their own preparations for the project (on digital video) and the background interviews that will become part of their film (on 16 mm film). The interviews are frequently quite funny -- including a mother whose toddler grows disturbed by the scary story she's telling -- while they also provide insight that the filmmakers really don't take the legend very seriously. The video pieces, meanwhile, establish character traits that become crucial later in the film. Heather, the project's leader, shows an unshakable-bordering-on-foolish confidence in herself, leading to trouble; Mike, who expresses concerns earlier than anyone, becomes the voice of common sense. Writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez don't just set up a scary story -- they set up the people to whom this scary story will happen. And folks, scary ain't even the half of it. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is the kind of film that wreaks its havoc almost entirely in your head, just as the events in the film wreak havoc in the heads of the characters. The directors use darkness and sound with shudder-inducing effectiveness, never once resorting to cheap, trite tricks like people jumping into frame or blasts of dissonant music (there is, in fact, no musical underscore of any kind). What we experience in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is the collapse of sanity -- as days go by, the three filmmakers run out of food, suffer from sleep deprivation and cold, and gradually come to believe that they may never find their way home again. Heather reassures herself and the others early in their experience that ""it's very hard to get lost in America, and even harder to stay lost,"" but the film plays on exactly that fear of the wildnerness with a technique that will leave you adrenaline-charged and breathless. Some viewers may be put off by the fact that the set-up guarantees a bad end for the protagonists, or incredulous regarding why they would continue to record their experiences. Those elements might have troubled me had THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT not established its characters so well that they mattered more than the situation in which they find themselves. All three of the largely-improvised performances are dead on -- I dare a viewer to find a moment when you can tell anyone is acting -- but Heather Donahue's work is emotionally shattering. Late in the film, she videotapes an apology to her own parents and the parents of the two men for placing them in such danger, the camera capturing only her eyes as she speaks. They are the eyes of a hunted animal, and the words she speaks will chill you to your soul. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT works as a study of disintegrating humanity only because we feel the humanity of these three brash kids to begin with. You expect a good horror film to be terrifying. What makes this one great -- perhaps one of the best ever -- is that it's also heartbreaking.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"RATING: 10/10 - ALTERNATIVE RATING: A ""On October 21, 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams hiked into the Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary film on a local legend called 'The Blair Witch,' and were never seen again. One year later, their footage was found."" This is the beginning of one of the greatest achievements in the horror genre and a wonderful step away from the well known blood-and-gut-clishes. 'Blair Witch' set a box office record of having the highest profits per screen than any film has had before (Previous holder was Star Wars Episode 1). While all good sense suggests that only an experienced and acclaimed director would venture into something as controversial and original, this is not the case. This instant classic is created by two totally unknown directors and three unknown actors, sculptured from a $20.000 budget. What follows the chilling prologue, is the footage that was ultimately found in the forest, meticulously edited together from the 16mm and video formats they used to shoot it on. Set up as a sort of pseudo-documentary about three high school teens that venture into the woods to visit the sites of certain grisly events.What starts as a fun outing in the woods, turns into hell. Before long, they get the sense that someone or something is playing games with them. And when their map disappears and their compass stops working, panic sets in... ""The Blair Witch Project"" works, not only because of its original and unique style of production, but because the three central actors create believable, authentic characters. Acting is on a totally different level, than you get used to after watching too many ""Scream""- features. Their entirely believable performances which, for the most part, were improvised for the eight days they spent in the woods, are mind-blowing, to say the least. This combination of incredible acting and superior production design, create an incredible realistic effect. While watching the film, not for a single moment will you doubt in the authenticity of characters and events displayed. There is no severed limbs or flowing blood in 'Blair Witch', which plays on a much higher intellectual level than most of the films in its genre. Although the film is made as a bad homemade movie, it reveals a lot of information, without seeming to. It's beautifully directed as it shifts from terror and panic to plain old apathy and flat out exhaustion. And again resuming that high level of panic, as the characters realize that it is the end, wonderfully displaying a very natural psychological evolution of characters. As Heather, as well as Michael and Joshua, slowly break down, becoming vulnerable and beyond frightened, they have nothing to do but pray that they will make their way out of the seemingly endless wilderness alive. In a late scene, filled with and incredible power and truthfulness, Heather, centering the camera directly on her right eye and nose, pours all of her emotions out, confessing to the faults of her own life, apologizing to her family, her comrades' families, her friends, and finally, making peace with herself. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking. The witch is never actually shown. This mystic creature somehow represents all our fears for the unknown. It may be a frightening story we might have heard and remembered, a UFO we think we have seen or something else - personal and intimate. As any little kid knows, it is the noise in the dark that is scarier than whatever is really out there making the noise. The human mind can imagine more in any given point in time than anyone could ever put on screen. 'The Blair Witch Project' doesn't need any digital monsters or special effects. This movie taps into the raw nerves of basic emotional response.(One of the reasons ""Deep Blue Sea"" never achieved the high professionalism of ""Jaws""). The film is frightening because every audience member relives his deepest fears once again while watching it. Whether this film has lived up to its hype, you can judge for yourself, but one fact remains: Eduardo Sánchez (II) and Daniel Myrick have created an instant classic and certainly one of the most ambitious and interesting films of the year.

Chuck Schwartz/ CrankyCritic.com 223 East 61st Street Apt 5B New York, NY 10021 Cranky Critic® movie reviews: The Blair Witch Project not rated, 87 minutes Starring Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez website: www.blairwitch.com IN SHORT: The buzz was better than the movie. Cranky has written before of how those of us who make our living reviewing movies are a small, compact community, who share the buzz on ""small"" or independent flicks that may otherwise be overlooked. Over the last six months there's been major buzz about a no-name flick -- that means no star actors or production folk. It's no reflection on talent -- called The Blair Witch Project. Word was this documentary style horror flick was tremendous, which explains the packed house in the screening room when we got our first look at the flick this past June. The story concept was great: Three budding filmmakers, Heather Donahue (director), Michael Williams (sound), and Joshua Leonard (camera) are shooting a documentary on an 18th century ""witch"" named Elly Dedward when they vanish forever into a Maryland woods. A year later, their film and tape is found and is edited into a coherent form by the team of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, revealing the physically deterioration and psychological self-destruction of eight lost days during which the group finds themselves hunted by an unknown entity. The only problem is, the history of the ""Blair Witch"" isn't well documented in the film. The ""filmmakers"" spend more time focussing on a 1940s child killer who stalked the town and don't make a strong link between that ""possession"" and others that have occurred over the past two centuries (I'll get back to that). Residents of the town of Burkittsville (formerly Blair) are interviewed about what they know of the witch or the killer in the first half of the film that is very entertaining. Once they get lost in the woods, and I'll not give most of that away, the film begins to feel like something that was made up on the spot. Which it was. Myrick and Sanchez gave the three actors film and video equipment to shoot with and story notes from which they were then left to improvise. The net result are scenes that sometimes look totally natural, and sometimes look like a bunch of scenery chewing. ""Mike"" goes through mood swings that a) make you wish he had brought a Valium drip with him and b) detract from the better than usual improv job done by ""Heather"" and ""Josh"". That pair are more consistent in their characterizations but the overall picture just isn't scary. No one ever implied that BWP was a slice 'n' dice flick. If that's what you expect in your scareflicks, you won't like this. This is one of the few times that the website is a vital resource, and more entertaining, than the film. There's a tremendous amount of material documenting the ""witch"" or the alleged possessions (there are more than one). Having the background details down cold will help fill in the gaps for you and may raise the tension levels high enough that you get a fright or two. Cranky got the material just before his screening, and knowing the details only pointed out the failure of the improvisations. On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were Cranky able to set his own price to The Blair Witch Project, he would have paid... and, as we used to say in school, an ""A"" for effort. The sum of the parts do not make for an enthralling whole. Cranky Critic® is a Registered Trademark of, and Copyright © by, Chuck Schwartz. All Rights Reserved.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project Dirs: Edward Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. Starring Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard. The pitch: Three student filmmakers disappear in the forests of rural Maryland while shooting a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch. A year later, their footage is found. This no-budget faux documentary was hyped last summer as the scariest movie ever made. Don't believe it. Creepy, yes. Scary? See Hitchcock's Psycho. Blair Witch is mainly nauseating, since the shaky, hand-held camerawork will make some viewers wish they'd brought a bottle of Dramamine to go with the popcorn. The brilliant gimmick behind Blair Witch can be found in the synergy between the movie and a detailed web site developed by co-director Sanchez. More than a year ago he posted an elaborate back story about the legend of the witch, dating to the 18th century. Thanks to market saturation, now almost everyone knows that this is a work of fiction, an exploitation film, really, that may eventually become the most profitable movie ever made. The directors let their actors film the picture during an eight-day shoot in the forests of a Maryland state park. The result is amateurish at times -- itchy and scratchy to be sure -- but that's precisely the point. Realism is the movie's strong suit. Heather, Josh and Mike think they're terribly cool. And Heather, for one, is wrapped a little too tight for her own good. She's pushy as hell and that's what gets the trio in trouble. Making constant quips and mocking the locals they've come to interview, the students are quite impressed with themselves and Heather's project  to shoot a documentary tracing the lore of a murderous spirit. The Blair Witch has supposedly been haunting the woods of Burkittesville, Md., for two centuries. Heather, the director, keeps a chronicle of the behind-the-scenes story, shooting everything they say and do with her Hi8 videocamera. Josh handles the 16mm camera, shooting black and white film. Mike wields the digital audio tape recorder. Their skills with film equipment contrast sharply with their incompetence in the woods. After interviewing the local yahoos about the witch, they venture into the forest and are lost within a day. About the same time they discover their predicament, someone or something begins stalking them. Strange totems appear outside their tent in the morning. Soon they are rabid with fear, living like hunted animals. To tell more would be unfair. The buildup to the shocks is slow and sometimes tedious, as the directors seem to be padding out their footage to get the picture up to feature length (it runs a scant 82 minutes). But when the ride starts, grab something and hang on. Ultimately, Blair Witch succeeds on the basis of what it doesn't show us. The terror builds in our imaginations as we wonder what is out there, just beyond the range of Heather's camcorder light. Obviously something terrible will happen  we know that much from the opening titles. The suspense comes from wondering what will happen. The final image, though ambiguous, becomes meaningful if careful attention is paid during the first half-hour. Subtle clues are peppered throughout the picture, although there is no definitive explanation before the credits roll. Stick around after the film. On video, the directors have added about five minutes of `newly discovered' footage, which consists of the actors yakking in their tent at night. The conversation is clearly intended to offer more clues about what happened to Heather, Josh and Mike, though it's still far from concrete. Some viewers will not be satisfied by the vague ending. We think there's a different problem altogether (hey, if this movie can play games with reality, then so can we): Filmmakers who go into the woods on a witch hunt ought to have enough sense to pack heat and extra ammo. At Cinema Uprising, our motto is `be prepared.' If the Blair Witch came a-creeping in the night, and tried to unzip our tent, well, by gawd we'd be ready. `Say hello to Mr. 9mm,' we'd tell the old hag, or whatever the hell is slinking through the forest, disturbing our sleep. And pop, pop, pop: No mo' witch. We might not have enough footage for a feature-length film, but we'd come back with a cool short subject. And a trophy for the den. Problem is, most campers just aren't ready for an extended stay in the wilderness. So we wind up with these herky-jerky horror films instead. As such, Blair Witch delivers several good jolts for viewers who can stick with it through the slow beginning. Its real triumph, though, is an exploration of group dynamics  how three friends slowly unravel in the woods and turn on each other, clamoring to get away. Rated R for language. No gore, no onscreen violence, minimal blood. Cinema Uprising copyright C 1999 by Stephen B. Evans. All rights reserved.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Starring: Heather Donahue, Mike Williams and Joshua Leonard After months and months of anticipation, Blair Witch has finally gone wide, playing in more than 1000 screens. To some, it may be the film you've been looking for this year, to others, including myself, it's a flawed bone chiller. The film begins quite uniquely. It turns out that 3 people,Heather Donahue, Mike Williams and Joshua Leonard, went into the forest to do a project on the mythical Blair Witch, and were never found. The only evidence left of their trip, was film from an 18mm video camera. The interesting thing about the use of the camera is the fact that it's 18mm, because it's as if the whole situation seemed like a reality. Unfortunately it made me a little queezy at times because it was too jumpy. Motion sickness people beware. Another positive note is, that there are no big budget effects or big named actors to make it a blockbuster, just normal people who act like they do on a every day basis who get lost in the woods. That itself seperates it from any other film out there, but with that said, it still feels a bit staged. There are many unbelivable situations that occur, some of which gets the film lost itself. For 1 thing, it's highly doubtful anyone would tape themselves when they're scared to the bone. It just isn't human. Many people were saying that the hype would ruin the experience, but it's a false statement. You are so intensely interested in their venture into the woods, that you clear you mind of most everything. Not too amny films can put you in that state. One disappointing thing that I noticed was the lack of terror. Sure it was chilling to hear blood curling screams in pure darkness, and eerie sounds, but that's enough to get you frightened. In fact, it spends more time trying to get to know the character's, that you wind up laughing at their jokes more than being terrified. Don't get me wrong the characters did a fine job. We all could relate to the nightmarish time they were having in these woods, becoming more frightened and paranoid by the minute. I have to give credit to the real filmakers though, this film delivers it's originality. It's not the same old slasher flick, it's a horror film that makes you cringe in fear at the chilling sounds, pay attention to the intriguing story, ponder into what is really going on. All these emotions never pop up in one's mind when they watch a gore infested film. It dares to be different and doesn't let down. By the end, everyone seems to lose it in the audience and on screen. The film spends a good amount of time building up to the end, where everyone sits still biting their nails or feeling sick to their stomach, but by then it's over. It ends so quickly audiences aren't sure what they saw right then and there until they have a few minutes to think about it. Strange? Maybe, but it's sure one chill fest, that will be buried in your mind for quite some time, despite it's unpleasant atmosphere.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"{Please be advised that during the course of this review, I may speak of things that could spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.} A low budget fright fest, The Blair Witch Project plays upon our now-programmed ideology, brought about by News footage and Real Video programs, that video footage is ""truth"", bringing a realism to the story that probably wouldn't exist if it were made entirely on film. TBWP has had a great turn of excellent hype and word of mouth, but it didn't do it for me. The story elements of the Blair Witch during the beginning of the film went by too fast, and some key elements that were to be foreshadowed later on, zipped by almost imperceptibly. The BWP website gives much detailed information about the background of the Blair Witch, more than is presented in the film. This, in my mind, is good and bad. Good that we get the fascinating background information, bad that most of it isn't in the film. The characters were all realistic and well acted, considering that the entirety of their performances was more or less improvised on the spot. Their camerawork has an honest amateurism to it, but the constant shakiness wore me down, and inability to turn off the auto focus would have been something any filmmaker worth their salt would have done. (Unless, of course they were told to turn off the auto-focus.) Also the rationale of constantly taping every day's events was thin at best, other than that if they didn't there wouldn't have been much of a film. And on that note, while the characters are lost and hungry in the woods, why doesn't Heather take out her book ""How to Stay Alive in the Woods"" which we clearly see at the beginning of the film? I guess she only had it out of a sense of irony. The characters also seem to dump the human instinct of self preservation and ""flight or fight"", that say, that characters in ""The Edge"" displayed so well. In that film, it was a Bear, Not a ""Ghost"" or a ""Witch"", or a ""Witch's Ghost"". A large bonfire was built in that film to light up the darkness, and weapons were fashioned for self protection from a very real, menacing Grizzly Bear. But what do our intrepid filmmakers do? They hide themselves in a cramped tent and complain that they're out of smokes. And for that, they deserve thier fate. After they team leaves the town and finishes their interviews of the townsfolk ,the film breaks down into simple formula: Walk around. Tape stuff. Get lost. ""Colorfully"" complain about how lost they are. Gradual group dynamic and individual breakdown. Sleep in tent. Get scared late at night. Repeat. The days were longest parts of the film, and while the conflicts between the characters were fine, and shouldn't have been made any shorter, the night scenes should have been made longer, considering they were the best parts of the film, although they never became more than fleetingly frightful. In contrast, the climax, taking place in the old house in the woods had what all the other night scenes didn't have. A sense of dread. The characters became separated (which is a genre no-no) and the character Mike frantically rushes around the house looking for Josh, the member of the team who went missing, whose voice can be heard yelling, from no discernible direction. Meanwhile, Heather tries to follow him, screaming all the way. It was the best edited, best shot scene, and the most effective. Had the other night scenes been this effective, the film would have lived up to the hype. Although I would have liked to have seen the Blair Witch at least once. Not seen dead on, but seen for less than a split second, moving just out of frame, enough so that we can see it, but not enough to make out what it is, or even so that we debate that we saw it at all. Although I didn't really like the film, it later played with my imagination like a good spook story, making every little noise a threat, and I caught myself occasionally looking over my shoulder. But I wanted more satisfaction in the theatre, not a creepy afterglow. If I wanted creepy afterglow, I'd go to the secondhand bookstore and pick up a spooky ghost story book for less than 2 bucks. Instead I blew 9 bucks on a shaky 80 minute home video. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com Rarely does a film live up to its hype quite the way this one does. Blair Witch roared out of Sundance with buzz calling it the scariest movie ever made. I am prepared to not only back up that statement, but to add that it will likely be the scariest movie that will ever be made. At least in my lifetime. And I'm relatively young. This isn't your average teen slasher flick with a cast raided from the ranks of the WB. Blair Witch is an extremely low-budget experiment by first-timers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. Their premise is simple: Three student filmmakers venture into the woods near Burkitsville, Maryland to make a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. They are never seen again and what the viewer is watching is their film footage, which has just been recovered one year later. Don't let the trailers fool you  only the last five seconds of them are culled from the film. The rest has all been added to make the incident seem more dramatic and real, which it's not. Well, it's not really real. The film you're watching is the actual film shot by these three kids. The directors sent them into the woods armed with a home video camera, a 16mm black-and-white camera and a DAT recorder, with only vague directions and no real idea of what might happen to them. So you see and hear everything that happens as it happens. It is more improvising then acting, and when these people are terrified, they are genuinely terrified. The film begins slowly, but once it takes off, you'll be on the ride of your life. Blair Witch opens with the kids interviewing local residents of the small town about their knowledge of the legend. Then they venture off into the forest with the intention of spending a couple of days and nights filming a few of the places where the Blair Witch was reported to have wreaked havoc on innocent townsfolk that dared venture into her woods. They see the graves of several children, and they find the rock from which several fishermen reportedly disappeared. The first night is uneventful  Josh thinks he heard something, but the others (Heather and Michael) just laugh it off, thinking that he's just trying to spook them. The next night, the sound is louder and heard by all three. By the third night, the group has lost their map, has no idea of their location are and literally run screaming from their tent as something appears to be attacking it from the outside. Then it gets really scary. Hell, `scary' isn't a strong enough word. I don't think a strong enough word exists. There are no scary monsters, splattered blood or musical crescendos to make you jump, but I still found my heart pounding out of my chest, my hands covering my mouth and my stomach nauseous. And I love scary movies. The ending of the film is so disturbing that it can't be described. It's been several weeks since I've seen the film and I still can't get Heather's screaming out of my head. She doesn't seem to be acting; it sounds like the actual screams of a person that thinks she's going to die. It's more than a little sick, but it's more effective than anything you've ever seen or heard. When the credits rolled, I sat slumped on my seat with my mouth hanging open, thunderstruck from what I had just witnessed. It took me several seconds to realize that I wasn't breathing. And I wanted to see it again. Immediately. Do not miss this film for any reason. See it at night. Park in an isolated spot in the back of the theater and try not to soil yourself as you walk back to your car. This isn't Scream, where you were laughing on the way home. This is serious, hardcore terror and is definitely not for the weak-hearted. (1:29 - R for language and psychological horror that you will never be able to escape.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"At a perfect running length of 80 minutes, 'The Blair Witch Project' is a completely fictional film that looks ferociously like a documentary. It uses mostly the thought of horror instead of visual horror itself to make its effective showcase a truly memorable horror film that will have you looking over your shoulder in the theatre. That's something few big budget Hollywood films these days are able to do. The film was made for around thirty thousand dollars, the cost of a new car with several luxuries and is destined to do well with young audiences. Based on the fictional premise that a group of young student film makers went into the woods in October 1994 to film a story about the legendary Blair witch, gives 'The Blair Witch Project' its name. Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard play the threesome who are ambitious yet naive, disorganized, irresponsible much of the time, and most of all tenacious. The film reports that during the week or so they went hiking in the reclusive woods of Maryland, they were never heard from again and that their footage was found a year after their disappearance and that footage is their story. It begins with the group using various methods of recording such as both black and white and colour to tell the story of how they are preparing to leave for their excursion. We see them at home, in the driveway and in their hotel on 16 mm film. Then the film picks up considerably from this point. They talk to various people who have heard stories of the legendary Blair witch, some believing in the story and some not. Their journey into the forest gives them the lesson of their lives which may be their last. This film may do for camping what 'Jaws' did for going swimming in the ocean. One of the people in the town with whom they spoke before leaving for the woods, tells of a story about a strange collection of rocks in a certain arrangement. They find it and it becomes part of their story as a chill is sent down their spines about this prophecy coming true and the consequences that may come with it. They also find a ritual style of trees arranged in a frightening manner which further threatens their sanity which they later try desparately to maintain. As the film moves on, their first night in the woods goes without much of a hitch. As things go on they get worse and worse. One of them throws the map away that was their salvation out of the forest, they run low on food and water and hike around in a circle only to find themselves back where they started. They make a humourous reference to the film 'Deliverance' which is intended to get a few laughs. They hear strange noises in dark and far away places in the woods at night and feel that their lives are in danger. Tempers flare and we see this all done in a true professional style with a script that looks like it was ALL improvised. In fact, much of the film was reportedly improvised but not knowing which scenes were and which weren't make it seem all the more impressive in its final blend. In a big Hollywood production you can usually tell which parts are improvised. The acting is top notch as we see the shift in friendships turn to hate and frustration. Film makers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have written, directed and edited a documentary style motion picture (and you still won't believe that it ISN'T a documentary) that shows they have a promising career if they stay focused with their own visions and don't sell out to the Hollywood style claptrap. The Cohen brothers ('Fargo') have been the main artists that have avoided doing this and are the true material that film students should take their cues from. Perhaps Myrick and Sanchez have.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project (1999) 4 stars out of 4. Starring Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. So few events live up to their advanced hype that it's a pleasure to report that ""The Blair Witch Project"" indeed fulfills all the expectations created by the past several months of buzz. ""The Blair Witch Project,"" a small independent movie about a trio of filmmakers who disappear in the woods of Maryland, is one of the most harrowing films you will ever have the fortune of viewing. The movie follows a basic tenet of filmmaking: Put ordinary people in ordinary surroundings, create an extraordinary situation and see what happens. As human beings, our most primal fear is of the unknown - of those things that go bump in the night. We may sense something, even believe we hear it, but if it remains unseen, our imagination becomes our worst enemy. It runs rampant with dread, creating worst-case scenarios that can drive a person mad. And that is the genius of ""The Blair Witch Project."" It plays upon those fears like a violin virtuoso plucking at our nerves, assaulting our senses. What makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" so frightening is its understanding of the mundane, of normalcy. The movie is not set on some alien planet or in some dank, dark castle in a distant land. It's here in the woods. And the woods, for the most part, are associated with pleasurable experiences - camping, hiking, sex. Scorning the use of special effects, filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez utilize rocks and sticks to generate an unsettling atmosphere of suspense, which slowly but continually builds: first to curiosity, then to dread, up to fear and ultimately to outright horror. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the quintessential independent movie. - shot on a shoestring budget, relying heavily on improvisation. It is ragged and dizzying, and this rawness - again - contributes to the overall uneasiness that multiplies as the film careens to its abrupt climax. The trio of actors - Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard - were given camera equipment and sets of instructions by Myrick and Sanchez, turned loose in the woods and were allowed to improvise most of their dialogue. This illusion of reality permits them an enhanced sense of hysteria as they stumble lost through the forest, which becomes more foreboding as the movie progresses. Their dialogue is not Shakespeare, consisting mostly of ""We're lost,"" ""Where the fuck are we?"", ""What's that?"" as well as intermittent arguments as they take turns accusing each other of incompetence and placing all their lives in jeopardy. They curse and swear at each other while continuing to cling together for safety. The true-to-life manner in which they deliver their inane lines only adds to the realism and the horror of their predicament. The three actors start off self-assured, almost cocky, and by the end are babbling, frightened children. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not for the faint hearted, yet it is neither explicitly violent or bloody. It is nerve-wracking and intense. It is not a movie you want to see alone. I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" at a midnight screening. When I arrived home and climbed out of my car, I know I walked a little more briskly than usual to get into my house. The movie will cause you to do the same. Bob Bloom is the film critic at the Journal and Courier in Lafayette, IN.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"To that short list of things money can't buy, let's add ""fright."" After all, as too many of us found out last week, the multiple millions of dollars spent on ""The Haunting"" produced only a great-looking, utterly ridiculous mess instead of a world-class shocker. On the other hand, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which cost a mere $60,000, is a nerve-wracking study of the psychology of fear that's doesn't need computer-generated special effects or digital stereo screams to give viewers the shudders. Instead, ""Witch"" writer-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have pulled off the trick of turning their lack of resources into an asset. The movie's unfinished, catch-as-catch-can look, complete with jiggly camerawork and sometimes blurred imagery, is one of the primary reasons it's so disturbing and creepy. ""Witch"" purports to be an assemblage of the film and video shot by three student filmmakers who ventured deep into the Maryland woods in 1994 in search of material for a project they were planning about ""the Blair Witch,"" a legendary figure locals have blamed over the years for mysterious disappearances and murders. The Witch is described by one source as being uncommonly hairy, by another as ""an old woman whose feet never touch the ground."" At first, the trio of young documentarians mock these theories and spend a good deal of their time fooling around and teasing each other. Even when they lose their way in the forest, Heather, the unofficial leader of the group, assures her cohorts they'll ""all look back on this and laugh heartily."" Instead, their circumstances become increasingly more serious, even perilous. Mysterious piles of rocks appear around their campsite, indecipherable noises surround them in the night, cryptic symbols are found and the leafless tree branches begin to look like skeletal fingers reaching out for the three intruders. What started off as a weekend of fun begins to look like ""Road Rules: The Death Trip."" Myrick and Sanchez understand that what frightens audiences is not what they see, but what they don't see. In its use of shadow, sound and suggestion, ""Witch"" recalls the classic Val Lewton films of the 1940s, such as ""Cat People,"" ""Isle of the Dead"" and ""The Seventh Victim."" Myrick and Sanchez create a wholly believable atmosphere of tension and bewilderment that proves to be much scarier than any amount of blood or gore could be. In another offbeat move, Myrick and Sanchez have given their characters the same names as the actors playing them -- Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams -- and the stars' naturalistic performances and seemingly improvised dialogue lend the tale an eerie authenticity. Particularly chilling is Donahue's taped confession when she realizes she doesn't know nearly as much as she thought she did. It's a scene that's almost too wrenching to watch. Shot entirely on video and 16mm film, ""Witch"" is presented in a constrained format that takes up only about half the total space on a movie screen. That's a brilliant move on the part of the directors since it makes us feel trapped right alongside the would-be filmmakers. We see only what they see, -- and it becomes clear why they're terrified.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project Directed by: Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick Starring: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams Running time: 88 minutes My rating (5 star scale): ** I have a confession to make. I scare easily. I can be scared by an episode of Charmed. I can be scared by books, tv, and movies. I've read Lord of the Rings a dozen times and parts of it still spook me. The Blair Witch Project has been touted as a truly scary movie. A movie which scares you with your imagination and not expensive special fx. Now, I agree that kind of scare is the best, but I didn't see it here. At most, I found myself occasionally amused and often bored. But never, not for an instant, really scared. Heather, Josh, and Mike are three would-be documentarians. They are making a documentary about the Blair witch, a mythical character who haunts the woods near Burkittsville (formerly Blair). They start by interviewing some locals. They hear stories about the witch, a child killer, the mysterious deaths of several men and the disappearance of their bodies. It's all vague and in the past and mostly from pretty unreliable sources. They head into the woods to camp for a couple of days and film some of the sites mentioned in the local legends. And things start going wrong. None of them is very good at reading the map, which may not be accurate anyway. There are mysterious noises in the night. They find strange piles of rocks and bundles of sticks. They fall behind schedule and start bickering amongst themselves. Since the movie starts by telling us the film footage was recovered a year after the events and the three filmmakers disappeared, we aren't exactly surprised by the ending. But lots of movies start off by telling you the ending (Sunset Boulevard and DOA are two great examples). They work because you want to see how the characters get to that point. That's where Blair fails. Blair attempts to scare you by convincing you the story is true. The actors don't recreate events - they are actually living and filming what you see. This means some of the scenes are poorly lit and poorly framed - just as you would expect. Many of the events staged were done without the actors' knowledge - so their reaction is genuine. All this works, we get a film that looks like what it pretends to be. Unfortunately, realism isn't enough. Even documentary film makers realize they need to have a story as well. There is an attempt to create a story here by having us hear the legends and by having mysterious and unexplained things happen in the woods. I think that's where the directors made their mistake. The movie gets closest to scary when the characters squabble amongst themselves - not when they think they are confronting supernatural beings or rednecks out of Deliverance. It's that internal conflict that should have been the focus and that might have made this a truly scary film. Instead, we get a movie with an interesting style. I can see why so many critics have praised it. The directors had an idea and followed through well. And what they have is a well executed idea that falls short of success. I saw this at a matinee discount and still felt like asking for my money back. You will miss nothing by waiting for this to be available on video.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"TBWP is probably the single most profitable film ever. Not surprising, considering its tiny US$100,000 budget, to date it has earned in excess of US$130 million. That's a shocking 100 times profit! Rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics, by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews, the film just exploded in the box-office, raking in millions on its opening weekend. Shot in 16mm and video (I suspect.), the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary Blair Witch. Audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure, often wobbly and blurry at times, it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning. This is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences. TBWP is simply smart. Filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the Blair Witch as a school project, one may suspect (like yours truly) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making. Simply amazing in that respect, I must say. Talk about impact, oh yes, TBWP does have quite a bit, in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing. I did, especially the last bit but I'm not revealing more. You have to see it for yourself. I can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become. Could it be that finally, an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal? Or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning? Well, I guess the fact stays; TBWP is highly original, clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film. No gore, no special effects, I just can't get over how terribly smart this film is! The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"After finally seeing The Blair Witch Project (TBWP), my first thought was: ""I have not been affected like I was supposed to, back when I first heard about this film in February."" Of course, the film doesn't live up to the hype, not that any other film in history ever did. The hype surrounding this film is comparable to that of this year's Star Wars, and quite possibly 1989's Batman, which is the most hyped film I can ever remember. But the film on its own isn't bad, it's just not very good either. The premise, which everyone on earth is now familiar with, is that you are watching the filmed footage of three twentysomethings who went into the woods and disappeared while looking for the legendary Blair Witch. One of the major flaws of the film is that it never gives you a background on the witch, other than snippets of interviews with the locals the kids do in the first 20 minutes of the movie. And I don't want to hear that I should've visited the website, either! It should be in the movie. That's complete hogwash. The middle third of the movie shows the kids having a group mental breakdown as they become more and more lost, even retracing their own steps. The last third deals with one of the three disappearing and screaming in the distance, and the other two's search for him. This final act of the film is the best part of the movie, but unfortunately you wait 60 minutes for it. The night scenes are tense, but not frightening. The only part that actually upset me was the last scenes of the film, when the two remaining filmmakers stumble upon a dilapidated house in the middle of nowhere, and their friend screams from within. The two forget that they are in mortal danger, and run thru the house looking for their friend. This also is the part that I didn't understand: why are the remaining two still filming? It doesn't make sense. It's just too incredulous to even consider. The film ends abruptly, and the audience that I saw it with wasn't satisifed. But if you think about it, it can end only one way. There was much confusion from friends who saw it regarding what the remaining boy was doing standing in the corner for the last scene. After I explained that one of the interviewees briefly touched on a hermit (not the witch) who was possessed in the 1940's and made one person stand in a corner while he gutted the other, my friends said they missed that. I have to admit, I didn't miss it, but wondered why the witch would do that. The film does explain some of the ways the witch kills, but this was not one of them. After thinking about this some time, I realized it was a plot device to allow the viewer some, albeit little, closure. Another scene involves the finding of bloody teeth in the forrest after the one filmmaker disappears and his heard to be screaming in agony. I felt the scene wasn't necessary, and got away from the spirit of the film. If the film's premise is ""it's best not to know"", why go against it? In any event, I rate the film ** out of **** stars and add: wait for the video. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"***1/2 (out of 4) If you'd like to be creeped out by an amazing and shocking document, then go see THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT without reading this or any other review. If you want to steel your resolve before seeing it, then read on. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is an original urban myth. A title card tells us that the film you are about to see is true. Three filmmakers disappeared in 1994 while shooting a documentary about a legendary witch of Burkitsville, Maryland. The filmmakers vanished somewhere, somehow, in those woods. Finally, their footage was found and edited chronologically to make this movie. The three students, Josh, Michael and Heather, went in search of the ""Blair Witch."" According to legend, an old woman disappeared several hundred years ago and to this day she still haunts the woods outside the town. The trio drive from film school to the town. An early shot in the Burkitsville graveyard has Heather standing by a grave, reading from a book. She looks like a bad TV news anchor wannabe. It's very hokey, but then, she's no Ken Burns. Next they interview a few of the locals. A man tells how she's rumored to have killed her victims: killing one first while the others were forced to listen to the screams, standing in a corner. Another woman reassures her young daughter that there's no such thing as the Blair Witch-- then winks at the camera and mouths ""it's true."" A couple of fishermen debate whether or not they believe in the witch. All in all, the residents of Burkitsville look like ordinary people. The ones who talk about the witch look like the sorts of people who would believe in that sort of thing. The movie is shot mostly on video, with non-actors playing themselves. There are no bad actors because nobody's ""acting."" There was surely a rough script, but most of the performances were not rehearsed. Next the three have to pack up their gear and hike a day into the woods, to a spot where the witch was said to haunt. When they get there, Heather stages a scene where she reads an account of the witch from a certain cave. It's the exact spot where the witch supposedly abducted some children. Heather's documentary looks like it would have been pretty lame, but at least she's sticking to her schedule and her script. The three must camp in the ""haunted"" woods that night because of the length of the hike. The following day they pack their gear and head back to the car. But instead of ending up at their car, they end up -- well, somewhere else. In the 2 days hiking, they have become lost. (SPOILERS AHEAD: STOP READING NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.) As the title card tells you, they never get un-lost. Their agonizing descent from annoyance and anger to fear and desperation is not so much pitiable as it is horrible, which is exactly what Myrick and Sanchez were hoping for. There are four techniques that really make BLAIR WITCH effective. The first is absolutely essential for this type of horror movie. In order to be scared by the supernatural, you have to first be convinced of it. You have to be led by the hand from scoffing disbelief, through entertaining the theory, to buying in. The characters you empathize with have to start out saying ""yeah, right, ghosts"" and end up running and screaming. BLAIR WITCH does this very well: when the trio realize they're lost in the woods, they go through some very rational thoughts. They're not afraid a witch is going to eat them, they're just annoyed at the inconvenience: the rented equipment is going to be charged for an extra day, someone's girlfriend is going to be angry, their filming schedule has been ruined. The movie takes its time going through the descent to fear, which gives the audience time to come down with them. It is only after much screen time, when they run out of cigarettes, food, and water, that they start believing in the supernatural. And why not? You would too. The second technique is that it never shows you the agent of the terror. By making the ""witch"" invisible, there is always the possibility that the terror springs from the mind, from fear, hunger, and fatigue. Even if you become convinced that the terror is real, its invisibility will force your imagination to make the thing more horrible than any solid image could. The second technique is enhanced by the third, the amateur quality of the footage. Sometimes it's too dark or blurry to get a clear picture of even what's right in front of your face. Also, the whole concept of shooting on video and cheap filmstock gives the movie a look of reality that just can't be faked. Because the subjects acknowledge the camera, you can't as easily say ""it's just a movie."" Finally, the movie works so well because of its actors, who were put through quite an ordeal in the taping and filming of the movie. Myrick and Sanchez made their actors hike to a specified location with a map and a global positioning system; none of them were familiar with the terrain. They had to be in character the whole time the camera was running (which was a lot), and their emotion, jibes, and fights were probably 90% ""real."" To make it easier for them to stay in character, the characters were given the same names as the actors. Horror guru Pablo Kjolseth will tell you that this concept (of terrorizing your actors in order to get realistic looking ""fear"") is not original. Neither is the idea of creating an urban myth for the screen. Nevertheless THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT it is fresh for 1999, and most importantly, it worked. It really is the scariest movie in quite a long time.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard Written and Directed by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Running Time: 87 minutes Date Reviewed: July 31, 1999 The trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily. Three filmmakers venture into the woods of Maryland to track down the legend of the Blair Witch for a documentary they are making. They disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house. From there, things become a little more complicated. I can say, with absolute assurance, that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me. Although I know it was all a staged ""mockumentary"", there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you. I didn't feel much upon initially watching it. I just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts. I never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended I would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend. I've gotten chills every time I've brought it up since then. This is not a movie that hits you right away. Instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine, waits until you think everything is okay, then it slowly starts to creep it's way up into your mind. This is truly the most frightening movie I have ever had the pleasure to watch. The film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their Blair Witch film, so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work. This is as real as it gets folks. I don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though, because I guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera. The performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real, you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not. This is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing, especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera. The reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen. Word has it that a special edition DVD with boatloads of extras (hours of deleted scenes, alternate endings, commentary, the Sci-Fi Channel special, and others) is being planned for release. I urge Artisan Entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the DVD to rival all DVD's. I know I'll be first in line to buy one.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard. 1999 - 87 minutes (opens July 16, 1999 in limited release; July 30 wider) Rated R (for profanity and intensity). Reviewed April 5, 1999. ""On October 21, 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams hiked into the Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary film on a local legend called 'The Blair Witch,' and were never seen again. One year later, their footage was found."" This is the title card that appears at the start of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" a film made on a microscopic budget by first-time writer-directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick that probably caused more of a stir with audiences than any other motion picture that was showcased at this year's Sundance Film Festival. What follows is that footage that was ultimately found in the forest, meticulously edited together from the 16mm and video formats they used to shoot it on. Set up as a sort of pseudo-documentary, ""The Blair Witch Project"" begins with the three aforementioned Montgomery College students preparing for their trip to Burkittsville, Maryland, home of the legendary Blair Witch who, as the people they interview in the town tell it, lives within the Black Hills Forest and murdered a string of children in the 1940's. Playfully shrugging off such horrific stories, the headstrong Heather, constantly with a Hi-8 video camera in her hand and using a map and compass, leads Joshua (who is filming with a grainy black-and-white 16mm camera) and Michael (who is there to pick up the sound) deep into the woods for what is supposed to be a simple 2-day excursion. It doesn't turn out that way, however, as they ultimately never make it back to their car on the second day and are forced to set up camp another night. Faint footsteps are heard, and the next day, they discover voodoo dolls and eerie symbols hanging over the trees. As the days pass by, their food begins to dwindle, the pitch black, freezing nights grow more and more intense and threatening as increasingly loud cackling noises and screams are heard, and they become hopelessly lost within the mouth of the forest, the three students are forced to come to terms with themselves and reconstruct their vision of what raw, unadulterated horror really is. When was the last time you've been scared by a movie? No, strike that. When was the last time you have been so completely and utterly horrified by a motion picture that, when the end credits began to roll, you were left curled up in your chair, literally shaking, and filled with so many strong emotions that you weren't quite sure how to decipher it all? If your answer was never (which it most likely was), look no further than ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which is a horror film like no other. It is not another manufactured and slick ""Scream""-style flick, but a true horror movie, one drenched in such a thick, smothering veil of hopelessness and dread, not to mention utter realism, that it finally stops becoming merely a ""movie"" and is transformed into something that means more, as if you are watching a true-to-life documentation of the terror three students fell face-to-face upon on that fateful, chilly October week before they disappeared without a trace. Also, unlike any other film I have ever seen, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is constantly shown from the point-of-view of one of the characters, since the movie is made up of the footage they filmed. This cinema verite style of filmmaking adds to the constant feeling that what you are watching is not fiction, but genuinely authentic, as it puts the viewer smack dab in the middle of the absolute nightmare. Jittery, shaky, and hand-held, the camera ultimately takes on a life all its own, used as a sort of metaphor for the off-kilter frame-of-mind the characters are forced to obtain as their spirits diminish and they start to question whether they will survive their dire, to say the least, ordeal. To put it bluntly, there is no acting in ""The Blair Witch Project."" There is, since Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard are playing characters (despite have the same names), but what I mean is that there isn't a minute, a second, or even a frame where you can ever catch the actors ""acting."" Their entirely believable performances which, for the most part, were improvised for the eight days they spent in the woods, are mindblowing, to say the least. As the character of Heather starts off as a confidant young woman, and the leader of the group, she gradually finds that this feeling of always being right is only a facade to hide her own weaknesses and fears for the future. As Heather, as well as Michael and Joshua, slowly break down, becoming vulnerable and beyond frightened, they have nothing to do but pray that they will make their way out of the seemingly endless wilderness before whatever really is out there gets them. In a late scene, filled more power and truthfulness than I can remember in any other film I've ever seen, Heather, centering the camera directly on her right eye and nose, pours all of her emotions out, confessing to the faults of her own life, apologizing to her family, her comrades' families, her friends, and finally, making peace with herself. To see ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not to simply watch it, but to experience it. No film in recent memory has shocked me, petrified me, unsettled my spirits, and left me so enthusiastic afterwards, making me want to discuss and share the picture with others. After rustling through so many recent turkeys, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has reminded me why I love the sacred medium of film, and why I want to dedicate my life to it. Writer-directors Sanchez and Myrick have thrust upon the world a motion picture with more promise, originality, and excitement than I can remember, and as a horror film, without any actually physical gore or even violence, it is more unsettling, atmospheric, devastating, and unforgettable than I ever, in my wildest imagination, expected a film could possibly be.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"It's been a few weeks since this much-talked about film has been released. I've heard how critics have labeled this as the scariest movie in the last 20 years. I've heard how much the material is unsettling. And, I've heard that many people suffer headaches after watching this film because the footage is shot using hand-held cameras and thus the picture is shaky. And after absorbing all of these tales, a general sense of eerieness began to stir within my stomach. I became more curious to know about the Blair Witch Project, yet I was also afraid at the same time. This fear was probably caused by a combination of anticipation and anxiety that manifested within mind. When you don't know what to expect but only know that it's something that can only be tremendously frightening, that's the most intense fear that you can have. It eats you, it taunts you, and it drives you mad. In `BWP,' three students shooting a documentary mysteriously disappear in a heavily wooded area in western Maryland. A year later, the video footage is found, and the events that you see are supposedly the last days that the students were ever seen again. Heather, Josh and Mike are all excited to be a part of this project. It should only be a day or two of interviews with the local denizens of a small town where the Blair Witch myth has had the most resonance. After that, the three would travel into the woods to see if there's any evidence to substantiate the statements made by the local folks. Most of the townsfolk dismiss the Blair Witch as just folklore with no basis in fact. But they do come across a few that are more cautious with their statements. `I don't really believe in her, but I do believe enough in her to know not to go into those woods,' one woman says. Another eccentric woman tells of how she once saw the witch and described her as a haggardly old woman covered with fur that seemed to float on air. The Blair Witch may be nothing more than fodder for tabloid newspapers or perhaps a story similar to that of Bigfoot. Nonetheless, the three pack up their gear, and begin to explore the deep woods where the Blair Witch is said to roam. Their situation quickly worsens. They lose the map, they begin to hear unexplainable sounds in the dead of night, and when they wake up they find evidence that someone has been there. After much pleading by a frightened Josh and Mike, Heather believes that the best thing to do is to leave. But no matter what they do, they seem to always make the wrong choice. They walk around in circles as they fall short on supplies as well as morale. Soon, they fear that they are being hunted by something unseen. The fright factor begins to quickly escalate as each one slowly turns on one another and as each begins to lose their own sanity. Fear is slowly settling in, and the transformation is utterly disturbing. What makes their fear that much more gripping is that they have no idea what's out there. The otherwise pristine woods transforms into an unsettling landscape as branches cast strange shadows, the leaves ruffle in a most disconcerting way, and the howling wind sounds like cries of help possibly from the tortured victims of the Blair Witch. Their flashlights can not see far enough into the distance. When they run, the cameras are focused at the ground, which doesn't allow the audience to see where they are going. This is equally frustrating and frightening. Like me, their fear was probably caused by a combination of anticipation and anxiety that manifested within their minds. Is there really anything out there? No one can be really sure. Regardless, I found myself turning my head several times to avoid seeing what was on the screen. With its documentary-like style, the plight of the students (though completely fictional) seems very real, as does the fear that they (and the audience) experience. Unlike conventional scary movies like `Scream' where scenes allow us to shriek in delight, the audience uttered not a sound  complete dead silence. The film is not about the Blair Witch itself, but rather how fear overtakes us, strips us of our sanity, and reduces us to shriveling weaklings. It's haunting, it's frightening, it's gripping and it deserves a strong recommendation. But be warned, for even now I am still chilled by the film.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"For More ""MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton"" Visit: http://Welcome.to/MovieViews The Blair Witch Project, a low-budget horror movie that scared audiences silly at the Sundance Film Festival, has been receiving incredible acclaim among moviegoers. Certain critics have dubbed it `the scariest movie since The Exorcist'. I'll be honest with you: it ain't. But what director tag-team Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have achieved here is nothing short of extraordinary: opening the imagination to a world of frightening possibilities. Tell yourself calmly `It isn't real' before you enter the theater, and all should go smoothly. The Blair Witch is a mythical creature said to live in the backwoods of a small town called Burkitsville, Maryland. There have been many campfire stories told about the murders of children and other frightening occurrences, but no solid proof that the witch in question ever existed. Three young college students - Heather (Heather Donahue), Mikey (Michael Williams) and Josh (Joshua Leonard) - have set out to make a documentary of the Blair Witch. Food and supplies have been packed for a 2 or 3 day venture into the woods, where they hope to find historical landmarks that have a significance in their project. They interview the locals and find it to be common knowledge. However, neither three show any particular respect toward the legend; they merely view it as a fun trip into the woods and a chance to get very drunk. The entire 90-minutes of The Blair Witch Project is composed of choppy footage that, we are told, was found one year later. There are two cameras that the trio use: a full color hand-held camcorder operated by Heather to record the documentary in process, and a larger one used by Josh for real footage. Mikey, meanwhile, is the sound man. Sanchez and Myrick have made this film as real as humanly possible. The actors use their actual names, and the shoot was supposedly composed largely of improvisation, brought on by fear of the dark woods. When things become scary for the characters, the tension begins to build in the audience. They find themselves lost in the woods, stumbling upon frightening crosses and stick figures dangling from the trees. Some monologues are carried on in a pitch black setting taking place in the tent, and you can only imagine what's going on around them. Things become creepier than creepy when the group begins to hear children's voices, and other mysterious sounds, echoing through the woods in the night. We're very thankful when daylight hits. As spooky as all of this sounds, it is much scarier in the aftermath. You will go over certain scenes in your mind - in fact, one character's helpless screams are still repeating themselves in my head. The performances are air-tight, especially by Williams and Leonard. Occasionally, Heather Donahue's cries and outbursts of profanity seem forced. But, she also owns the most effective scene in the movie, in which she records her apologies to the group's parents while holding back sobs of terror. `I'm too scared to close my eyes, and I'm too scared to open them,' she explains. Sanchez and Myrick have wrung this great premise for every ounce of possible fear. It is not so horrific that you'll find yourself quivering in your seat, but it is scary. The ending contains one of the most frightening frames in movie history. And, with only one scene of brief violence, the directors have largely succeeded in proving one fact: that images the imagination can conjure up are far more frightening than anything shown on film. The Blair Witch Project is no phenomenon, but it is very, very well done. MOVIE VIEWS by Jamey Hughton: http://Welcome.to/MovieViews .......................

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"For me, a movie like ""The Blair Witch Project"" comes along every four or five years. It is the kind of movie that leaves me shaking....with anger. Angry that I was pick-pocketed out of $8 at the door (which, it turned out, was the scariest part of my Blair Witch experience)? No, angry that I spent an unrecoverable hour and a half of my life on one of the most vapid, go-nowhere movies I have seen in a long time. To obtain the most effective fright from any suspense/horror movie, I walked into ""The Blair Witch Project"" with little prior knowledge, eyes wide shut. I had not visited the movie's website, had only seen the (very interesting) trailer twice, and had heard secondhand that some critics *loved* this movie. Thus, I was perfectly (un)prepared for the horrors which I assumed would be laid out in the three filmmakers' documentary footage--the remains and the cornerstone of the docu-horror premise. What I watched instead was 90 minutes of three Gen Xers desperately trying to find sense where there was none to be found. Once lost in the woods, they puzzled over mounds of rock, suspiciously placed faggots, various nighttime sounds, and worst of all how they could walk in a straight line for 15 hours and wind up in the exact same place. Very, very frequently, with cameras pointing at each other or into the dark woods of Maryland, the twenty-something trio screamed and screamed and yelled ""fuck"" and ""oh fuck"" and then screamed some more. Suspenseful? The first time. Scary? Hardly. Annoying? Definately. Toward the end, during one of the many running, screaming, oh-fuck scenes--long after I realized this dog was going nowhere and about 5 minutes after one moviegoer in the aisle where I was sitting left never to return--I cynically wondered if the actors were screaming ""oh fuck"", because they realized that they had no script! With so many fundamentals missing from ""The Blair Witch Project"" (I was unsurprised to learn afterwards that there was indeed no script for this so-called film!), it is not difficult to see why such an effort fails so miserably. Without character development, without professional editing (in addition to being a yawner, the damn thing was LONG even at 90 minutes), and with a film-as-you go approach, it is little wonder that the movie finds itself running away from itself. The entertainment value of ""The Blair Witch Project"" comes later, long after the ""I've been had"" anger subsides. It's a pathetic, PATHETIC, B-movie and laughing about it will no doubt entertain and take the sting off of being ripped off. At the viewing I saw in Boston last night (July 17), the audience began its hilarity immediately, during the first millisecond of the closing credits. They laughed, they heckled, they mocked, and I can't help but wonder if they were thinking what I was thinking: I know what was in those woods in Maryland. It was P.T. Barnum.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" also has a wonderful cast. Tom Cruise eschews his trademark boyish smile (except for the opening scenes) for long stares usually at a low angle (A Kubrick motif). His slow descent into anger is thrilling to watch, and one of his most quixotic moments of his career is when he confronts his friend Ziegler and discovers the true nature behind his own adventurous and nocturnal activities. Nicole Kidman has become a first-rate actress, and her mood swings are something to behold. I also liked her laughing fit at Bill's remarks that he would not sleep with his patients - when was the last time that a character laughed at Tom Cruise? Her final moment of realization about their marriage is stunning - this woman should be nominated for an Oscar. Also worth mentioning is Sydney Pollack's quietly decadent millionaire character Ziegler - he is more fierce and yet just as restrained as he was in ""Tootsie"" or ""Husbands and Wives."" Vinessa Shaw displays a sweetness and sexiness not often seen on the silver screen, and she plays a prostitute! Rade Serbedzija (""Before the Rain"") has one of the sole moments of comic relief as the owner of the Rainbow, a costume shop, who asks the good doctor for advice about his balding spot. Todd Field is also engaging as the piano player Nick Nightingale who plays blindfolded at some musical events. If I have one or two gripes about Kubrick's long, difficult and splendid film, it is the abrupt ending and the inclusion of a character that would have been better omitted or replaced by a different actor. The ending is optimistic (a rarity in any of his films) but somehow feels rushed. Still, this is among the late master's finest films, preferable to the pretensions of ""The Shining"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" easily stands among such giants as ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Paths of Glory"" or ""2001."" It is a bizarre, strangely moving and enlightening film guaranteed to provoke as much controversy as anything he's ever done. Stanley, you may be gone, but we are glad you came back with one of the best films of your career.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard Written and Directed by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Running Time: 87 minutes Date Reviewed: July 30, 1999 In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. One year later, their footage was found. Thus begins The Blair Witch Project, one of the best (yet extremely frustrating) thriller/horror movies to be released in a long, long time. As this ultra low budget movie begins we follow the doomed film crew consisting of Heather the director (Heather Donahue), Josh the cameraman (Joshua Leonard), and Mike the sound guy (Michael C. Williams) getting ready to begin their documentary. They set out to the town of Burkittsville, Maryland and begin to interview the locals about an urban legend of sorts... the story of the Blair Witch. Various soundbites are gathered, and then on day two the crew sets off into the woods. They are never seen again. The audience however, vaguely gets to see what happened to them over the next few days, thanks to Heather's inexplicable urge to film every terrifying moment of their ordeal. All of the critical praise this film is getting might just work against it with the casual moviegoer. In countless ads and reviews the word ""scary"" is used over and over again. ""It's scary as hell."" ""The scariest movie ever."" Saying the film is scary is only going to frustrate the casual moviegoer who is expecting Poltergeist or The Haunting. There are no special effects, no scary music, and no monsters. Don't get me wrong though, it is CREEPY as hell (especially the film's final 30 seconds or so). However slight, there is actually a difference between scary and creepy. A scary movie would be something that makes you jump or even scream out loud, either by genuine terror or through those cheesy music cues when a cat jumps out of nowhere. A creepy movie like The Blair Witch Project sets the stage for something scary to happen... but ultimately never delivers. Nothing ever makes you jump and nothing ever makes you scream, even though the stage is fully set for that to happen at any given moment. Now let me give credit where credit it due. When The Blair Witch Project tries to be creepy it succeeds masterfully. As the crew settles down each night to sleep, that's when things start to get creepy. Basically, whenever the sun goes down, get ready to almost be scared. That's mainly what kept frustrating me though. Sometimes the night would go by too quickly. If Heather is going to insist on continuing to film these now nightmarish conditions they are being exposed to, you would think that there would be more of these night scenes. Instead, there's more of the ""human drama"" which takes place during the daytime. The three principle cast members are all new to the film world, and all are very good here. I'm sure the casting was based simply on budgetary constraints, but the film just wouldn't have been as effective with any familiar faces. As a result of the casting, you feel like you're watching a real documentary. In today's day and age of whiz bang CGI effects and no-brainer Kevin Williamson crud, I'm all for the ""less is more"" approach for the horror genre. The Blair Witch Project takes that a step further, opting for the ""nothing is even less than less is more, so we'll give you nothing"" approach. The filmmakers lull you into a false sense of security with the first half of the film, which is basically just a humorous story about low budget documentarians. Then the creepiness sets in which is very effective, but as I said it ultimately never pays off. We know just as much about what happens to these people when the movie begins as we do when the final credits roll. In a way that bothers me, but the movie is entertaining and original enough to make me overlook it's non-payoff. Artisan Entertainment (the distributor of the film) has set up an EXTENSIVE and very cool web site for The Blair Witch Project. Check it out. Also, there's a special hour long documentary airing on The Sci-Fi Channel called Curse of the Blair Witch that actually manages to blur the lines between reality and the fantasy of this movie even further.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Due to a savvy marketing campaign, The Blair Witch Project was among the most anticipated of the summer, particularly among fans of independent film. It is a small budget film which demonstrates that an extravagant Hollywood production is not necessary to make a good film, as long as originality and creativity are employed. The prologue to the film claims that the filmmakers disappeared over a year ago, and that the film was constructed from the remains of their footage which was eventually found. In a clever stroke of marketing, the film's website goes into great detail about the disappearance and it constructs a detailed background legend that the filmmakers were investigating. Official websites for films are often merely an advertising mechanism that provide an overview of the story, a description of the cast, and a few stills from the film itself. It is noteworthy that the website for this film actually enhances the film by acting as an extension to the story. Although portrayed as reality, the events in this story are all fiction. In an age when every mundane new event (like a 45 mile per hour car chase on a crowded highway) is given national prominence by the network news organizations, it is unlikely that the bizarre events purported by this film could have escaped notice. As confirmation, there is the usual ""all characters and events in this film are fictitious"" disclaimer displayed at the end of the credits. However, knowing that the film is fictitious does not detract from the viewing experience. It actually enhances it because the viewer is allowed to enjoy the story fully rather than be distracted by implausibilities. The footage begins as the three main characters are embarking on their project. They are college students putting together a film investigating the legend of the Blair Witch. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the director of the film and the project leader. Joshua (Joshua Leonard) is the camera operator and Michael (Michael Williams) is handling the sound. The footage begins as they interviewing current residents of Burkittesville, Maryland, which was previously a colonial town called Blair. The interviewees relate vague stories of the legendary witch who lived in the nearby woods, and also the story of serial child killer who murdered several of the town's children about fifty years earlier. It seems the killer was a hermit living in the woods who claimed to be possessed by the witch when he perpetrated the horrific crimes. Eventually the trio enters the woods in their search for particular historical landmarks related to the legend. From the premise it is known that they will meet with misfortune, and the tension builds as they proceed deeper into their journey. As they become lost and encounter strange occurrences, the suspense noticeably tightens as the audience wonders what their final fate will be. The genre of mock documentary (mockumentary) has been well established, and primarily used for comic effect (such as in the hilarious Man Bites Dog and This is Spinal Tap). While the comic mockumentary creates satire by portraying lampoons and exaggerations as reality, this film is unique in that it tries to build suspense and fear by attempting to keep all events believable. The fictitiousness of the stories is never belied by the acting as all three actors give outstanding, credible performances. The characters gradually transform from enthusiastic adventurers to terrified, edgy, and confused waifs. The main flaw is the uneven, and sometimes lingering pacing. The production is obviously amateur, but the genius is that it tries to portray a fictitious amateur production, so it succeeds perfectly in that aspect. Highly recommended. This film was subjected to a large amount of hype both before and after its release. For people who are expecting too much, or are expecting a tradition horror slaughterfest, it may be a disappointment. It is not the scariest movie, and is not intended to be. However, it carefully draws its boundaries and successfully executes within them. Although it is not perfect, it is a marvel of simplicity, originality, and creativity.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Starring Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed By Daniel Myrick and Ed Sanchez Running Time: 1 hour 20 minutes Arriving in a barrage of hype, The Blair Witch Project is one of the biggest box office success of the year. However, like The Golden Child, although Blair Witch has made a lot of money, it's not very good. Donahue, Williams and Leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the Blair Witch myth. The film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded, which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles. Although events start of normal, they get weird pretty quickly, while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on. Although an interesting premise, The Blair Witch Project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity. The biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise. Most of the dialogue is ad-libbed, and still manages to sound like a poor B-movie. The 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches, with the F-word included a lot to sound like students. There are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur, but then it's back to the shouting and swearing, which gets very tiresome very quickly. If I wanted to see three people get lost in the woods, shout a lot and swear, I'd go on scout camp. But no, the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this, but I'm not quite sure how. The supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting, especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes. With no music and no budget to work with, the film has to depend on natural, psychological scares, which are sometimes well delivered, sometimes not. I never really felt truly scared during any part of the film, although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film. However, because the actors are so irritating, the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to Heather saying 'What the f*ck is that?' a lot, and Mike giggling like a loony. There's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things. The main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment, and are hopelessly lost, Heather still insists on filming it all. The film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this, but it isn't very convincing. Also, the students have no idea how to survive in the woods, such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation. There are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged, Heather's apology being a major one. The Blair Witch Project, in the end, just fails to deliver. I suppose if you've been lost camping before, the film may deliver some chills, but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods. Apart from the final minutes, the film is mind boggingly unscary, and the shouting matches get hideously dull. The spook scenes are short and far between, and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide. Although a good idea, it's not executed well enough to be a fun, scary cinema experience. It's a worrying fact when the website (http://www.blairwitch.com) is better than the film.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good) 1999, R, 88 minutes [1 hour, 28 minutes] [horror] Starring: Heather Donahue (Heather), Michael C. Williams (Mike), Joshua Leonard (Josh); produced by Robin Cowie, Gregg Hale; written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. Seen July 31, 1999 at 6:10 p.m. at Crossgates Cinema 18 (Guilderland, NY), theater #10, with Reneé Gentile for free using my Hoyts season pass. [Theater rating: ***: very good picture and seats, average sound] Is there really anything scarier than the unseen? Don't you get scared to death when you come across one of those science shows on PBS about the millions of bacteria crawling all over you? Don't you freak out when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a loud noise coming from within your house? Have you ever been told an urban legend while sitting around a campfire or walking down a dark alley? That paranoia associated with the little voids that exist within our own, supposedly secure and advanced world is what `The Blair Witch Project' attempts to deal with through a unique style of filmmaking almost never utilized by the movies. The film puts itself forward as a collection of `real' footage shot by three film students who were never seen from again after they set out into some supposedly haunted woods in October 1994 to make a documentary on the local legend of `The Blair Witch.' There is no narration or outside footage except what was shot by the students (the actors) themselves. In case you don't know, the directors/creators Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez conceived the film as being the most realistic work of fiction an audience could see. They didn't write a script, all they did was come up with the major plot points and character traits and then sent the three actors out into the woods to make the movie themselves. Myrick and Sanchez and a few of their crew members kept tabs on the actors through global positioning units and had `booby traps' set and waiting so that everything the three experienced would be real. This technique certainly works for the film's many emotional points, although the lack of interesting dialogue and characterization serve as noticeable flaws. I'm not sure which is the most innovative concept at work here: the way the film was made; the fact a distributor decided to take a chance on it; or the fact that mainstream audiences seem to be just as excited and anxious to see something of the tiniest scale as they were for a few other summer flicks of the largest scales. Anyway, the film starts out with a lot of interviews with the local townsfolk and their interpretation, stories and alleged personal experiences with the Blair Witch. Some blow it off as nonsense, but others take it seriously. This lays the foundation for the bulk of the film and the actual climax itself which probably would have worked as well as it does whether or not this attempt at a backstory had been included. In fact, this is the film's weakest aspect because the interviews are a bit too short and informal and the characters don't think much of it either. Oh yes, the characters are: Heather (Donahue), the director who shoots almost everything she and her crew say on home video (which gives the film a realistic feeling because almost everyone has seen themselves on their parents' or their friends' home videos); Mike (Williams), the sound guy who doesn't say much at first except for a few snide remarks and one-liners, but who will later become full of emotion; and Josh (Leonard), the cinematographer who uses a grainy 16mm black-and-white camera. The three set out into the woods to hike to some specific landmarks associated with the legend which includes your common tall tale stories and places such as `Coffin Rock' and an old hermit's home and stories of children and hunters who were abducted and slaughtered by the witch. What ensues is not the three students' serious study of the legend, but of the psychological terror they will endure when they get lost, run out of food, fight with each other and then panic when they all fear they are being hunted. It's obvious to us why the three begin to break down and lash out at each other and what the strange sounds are that they hear at night. The most chilling and enduring scenes last only a few minutes when the three set up camp for a night and are awakened by noises and movement in the dark they attribute to either backwoods survivalists, animals or just the wind, but they never say what's clearly on their minds (and ours) - it's the witch. One of the single, most frightening moments I can recall occurs during one of these scenes where the crew is awakened by a presence outside their tent and the three flee into the woods, cameras rolling, and in the distance we see Heather running away and she screams, `My God, what the hell is that!?' This is what makes `The Blair Witch Project' so superior to the countless Hollywood gorefests about monsters, serial killers and vicious animals. It relies on our own imagination to determine just how horific the elements at play might be. Throughout the film the three encounter signs of an intelligence such as piles of rocks and stick figures hanging from trees that weren't there before. These things are so simple yet they are frightening because of their nature alone. We want to believe that we can logically explain any occurrence in this day and age, but the atmosphere of paranoia is too thick and overbearing and thus it's all pure fear. The final scene is the culmination of everything the film is. It's disturbing, scary and realistic and when the climax ensues and there hasn't been a drop of blood shed or a villain in a costume or a CGI, it's a powerful moment. However, I take issue with the fact so much more backstory about the Blair Witch legend and the students' film expedition has been covered on the movie's web page and other media sources than what was included in the film itself. To have the film be entirely a string of Heather, Mike and Josh's footage is a great idea and works well, but what if the film had been a fictional documentary about the students' documentary? It could have been complete with a vast historical background of the Blair Witch legend and the rescue efforts that supposedly took place in the days after the students were declared missing. That might contradict the theory Myrick and Sanchez were going for, but I doubt it would have hurt (especially considering the film's running time is less than 90 minutes and seems to fly by). Still, as my friend and fellow film critic Dustin Putman said, to see `The Blair Witch Project' is not just to sit in a theater and watch a movie, it's to really experience something. It works on an emotional and intelligent level I've not seen since `2001: A Space Odyssey,' in that an invisible powerful force has outsmarted us in a day and age where we think we know everything there is to know. --------------------------------- Please visit Chad'z Movie Page - over 230 new and old movies reviewed in-depth, not just blind ratings and blather capsules.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"When I was eight, my brother, a friend and I decided to camp out in our backyard on a summer night. We pitched a tent and rolled out sleeping bags. For us, this was almost ""roughing it."" We ate junk food, watched the skies for UFO's, and told ghost stories until the middle of the night. Sometime around 3 a.m., just as we were drifting off to sleep, we heard someone scream in the distance, about a block away. It was a loud, shrill scream. I've almost never been so frightened in my life. In a blind panic, we all rushed to the front of the tent, fumbled with the zipper, and trampled over each other get out of the tent and rushed inside the house, where lights, carpeting, and TV would seemingly protect us from whatever was lurking outside. Looking back, our terror seems silly and absurd, since we were in a fenced backyard of a suburban Los Angeles home, yards away from my parents' bedroom window. I'm not even sure today that what we heard was a woman screaming, not a cat. But on that night, it was what we couldn't see and didn't know that was so terrifying. What triggered my memory of that incident was The Blair Witch Project. This $35,000 independent film has stunned the entertainment industry by out-grossing many major studio releases this summer. The film deserves both the hype and ticket sales it has generated. It is a fresh, engaging, and flat-out scary film. Unlike the countless Scream clones and sci-fi monster movies, Blair is scary without relying on special effects, haunting soundtracks, or a teams of high-paid make-up artists. It draws on the primal fears all of us share, and have experienced at one time -- the fear of the unknown and the fear of being vulnerable and exposed. Presented as the recovered footage of three documentary filmmakers who vanished in the woods of Maryland while making a film about a legendary local witch, the movie depicts three college students as they go into the woods to explore the spooky local legend. You know it's not going to have a happy ending, but don't know what the characters are going to face. You're along for the ride, trying to figure out what's going on and what's out there, in the dark, just out of sight, before it reaches out and gets them. The film starts with the project's leader, Heather (Heather Donahue), who compulsively (and conveniently) tapes everything the group does, as she prepares for the trip. The documentary is supposed to examine the local legend of the ""Blair Witch,"" who has supposedly been responsible for several unsettling and mysterious deaths in Burkittsville, Maryland, since she was banished from the town in 1786. Heather is joined by fellow students Mike (Michael Williams) and Josh (Joshua Leonard), and the trio head to Burkittsville, where they interview people on the street about the legend. Some townspeople have never heard of the Blair Witch legend, while others seemingly know a lot about it. A few suggest to the filmmakers that they think she's still out there somewhere. In an eerie scene, a local woman explains on camera what she knows about the story of the witch, while the baby girl she is carrying keeps putting her hand over her mother's mouth, as if to keep the words from coming out. The next day, the three students strap on backpacks and head into the woods in search of some famous landmarks related to the history of the Blair Witch. They find a spot known as ""coffin rock,"" where five men's bodies were found ritualistically dismembered and inscribed with strange symbols in 1886. After that, the students set off to find an infamous graveyard deep in the woods. When they camp at night, odd things start happening, and they begin to hear noises nearby and sometimes right outside their tent. As they plod on, tensions rise along with fatigue and fear. Soon, they are lost and struggle to find their way out of the woods. Disturbing late-night visitations continue to plague them, and they begin to fear that their harassers may be worse than curious wildlife or mischievous rednecks. Heather, from the outset, is the in-control type -- always in charge of the map, always making decisions -- but as they become increasingly lost and fearful, you can see her sense the control over the situation slipping away, which perhaps scares her the most. Their cycle of hope, fatigue, and fear continue for days, leading up to some creepy developments, surprising final twists, and an absolutely chilling finale. The film's creators, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, didn't so much direct the film as manipulate it. They gave the three actors the basic backstory of the film, then sent them off on their own to film the scenes in the woods without any script. They would get daily messages to the actors about general plot developments and things to do, but otherwise, the actors improvised scenes and filmed them. In turn, the Myrick and Sanchez would review the tapes after each day and make suggestions for the next day. To keep the developments spontaneous, they kept the actors in the dark about what else would happen (except that they would not be hurt), so the late night disturbances faced by the actors were genuinely surprising, and no doubt, frightening to them. When the characters look tired, it's because the actors were tired. If they sound testy, they probably were. Reportedly, the directors warned the actors before taking the job that ""your safety is our concern, your conform it not."" (In fact, the actors, while alone in the woods, unlike the characters in the film, did have a GPS locator device in their gear to prevent them from genuinely becoming ""missing,"" like their fictional counterparts.) Part of what makes Blair effective is that it looks and feels genuine. The shaky camcorder effect isn't contrived as in some ads or in NYPD Blue, it's a camcorder being held by someone on the move or whose arm is actually shaking. The early part of the film looks like anyone's goofy camcorder tape -- people clowning off in front of the camera, playing with the zoom control, and hamming it up. By the time things start getting strange, the viewer has been sucked into the illusion that he or she is watching a real videotape of real people making a documentary. The film wouldn't work if you were constantly aware that these were three actors in the woods, dirty and tired, but perfectly safe. The improvisational acting in the film, mixed with genuine reactions of surprise, frustration, and fear, make the performances by the three actors convincing and compelling. Two of the actors have noted that people have recognized them since the film's release on the street and stopped them to express how relieved they are to see that they are safe after all. In the course of the 90-minute film, you see and feel the toll the experience takes on the characters, as they descend from frivolity, to frustration, to anger, to desperation, and finally, to sheer terror. The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest movies in recent years: a film that follows you around for a while after you leave the theater. Some friends who have seen the movie have told me that it disturbed them more a week after they saw the film than right after seeing it. It does a much better job at getting at the things that truly scare all of us than most contemporary horror films. The smartest move by its creators was to let the audience imagine the scariest parts of the film themselves. Many of the scariest elements of the film are just out of camera range, hard to hear clearly, too blurry to see, or just far enough away in the darkness that you can't see. That's what scares us in real life, what scared me years ago in my backyard, and what continues to frighten millions of audience members. When you leave the theater, you're not exactly sure what you saw, what you heard, or even what ultimately happened to the characters. And that, quite possibly, is the scariest part of the experience.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"For more reviews and movie screensavers, visit http://www.joblo.com/ This film made a major impression at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. This film made a major impression on moviegoers when it opened wide on July 30th, with a box-office gross of close to US$30 Million, with only a $30,000 filming budget. This film also made major impressions with most movie critics who agreed that this film was one of the creepiest rides of a lifetime. I must've missed that movie critic memo. This film made only a minor impression on me. PLOT: Three young filmmakers go out into the woods to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. They are lost and never heard from again, until someone finds all of their videotape footage. This film is a compilation of their footage from the woods. CRITIQUE: This film simply did not ""do it"" for me. I thought it was an original idea with an extremely authentic look and acting from its main characters, but God help if I didn't really find it all that interesting, scary or even entertaining. The last fifteen minutes of this film get a little creepy, and certainly leaves for an impression, but unfortunately, you have to sit through an hour and more of watching these three kids walking, talking shite, getting creeped out here and there, and whispering in the dark. I am assuming that all of this activity absorbed others into the characters and their plight, but I just thought it was pretty boring. It was like watching a camping trip video of some friends that I could care less about. I felt little tension, little suspense and absolutely no scares whatsoever. This is definitely NOT a scary movie. If there was ever a film to which you could stick the motto ""Don't believe the hype"", it would be this one. And I'm not saying that the film is garbage either. It's like I said, I thought the style and premise were interesting, the actors believable and solid in their roles, with funny moments here and there, but overall, the film just didn't do much for me. It got a little spooky near the end, and certainly tied itself nicely to a story told at the beginning of the film by a town person, but don't go into this film thinking that you are going to get your pants scared off of you, cause that's not its primary intention. In fact, if you have a problem watching a camera jittering about for an hour and a half, you may just get nauseous watching the film stock shot here. Did Mrs. JoBlo like it? Nope. I even caught her staring at the ceiling of the theatre every now and then. All in all, you obviously needn't take my word for it, since there are many huge fans of the film surfing the Web as we speak, but in my humble little opinion, the movie did not make any special impression upon me, and certainly did not entertain my sorry ass for its duration. And I think that is ultimately the main criteria of any film-- was it entertaining? In this case...no. See it on video, if interested. Little Known Facts about this film and its stars: In case some of you still aren't sure...Is the film a real documentary or not? THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is entirely fictional. The entire thing is the brainchild of the films' co-writers/co-directors, Ed Sanchez and Dan Myrick, and was made over the past two years. The three student filmmakers are all played by actors. The actors used their real names in the film, and the conditions were a bit different than your average shoot. First off, the actors actually had to agree (it was written into their contracts) that they could be messed with psychologically. Then, they were sent off into the woods for eight days, and literally shot the film themselves (Shot at the Seneca Creek State Park in Maryland). Over 18 hours of raw footage was generated from the excursion in the woods. The only contact that they had with the crew was through notes and minimal rations left for them to pick up daily (they also carried a GPS (Global Positioning Satellite receiver), so they couldn't really get lost, and so that the crew knew where they were in the forest and where to head for instructions and food.) They knew their ""characters"" well, and knew the general setup of the ""story"", but everything that happens as the story unfolds was a surprise to them. The film was shot in October of 1997 and the directors spend more than a year editing the film down to its final product. Has the legend of the ""Blair Witch"" also been fictionalized? Yes, it was also created by the filmmakers, as were all the supporting documents and all the events in the Blair Witch mythology (See http://www.blairwitch.com/). The filmmakers wanted to create a sense of history to add to the depth and believability of the film. This movie is the feature film debut of all three of its young stars, Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard. Michael is already set to co-star opposite Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Jr. in a film entitled NAVY DIVER, due out in the year 2000. Not too bad, eh? An alternative ending was shot for Artisan Entertainment, but the studio left the decision as to which ending to use to the filmmakers, so they went with their original ending. Maybe we will see this and some of the deleted scenes on the DVD release. Needless to say, ideas for prequels and sequels are already being seriously tossed around.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Glancing at the calendar, I note that only two weekends remain before I leave Washington, more or less permanently, for graduate school in Boston. This means that, barring an unprecedented burst of enthusiasm for music reviewing, or a completely predictable disinclination to pack, this will be the final column I write from my home on Capitol Hill. Had I thought some things through, I could have wound down my tenure here in Washington with a comprehensive overview of some local bands, or a best-of-DC list of some sort, but I tend to be a bit haphazard in my approach, and this column is no different. As turns out, summer 1999 will be remembered for my move from Washington to Boston, for my somewhat-delayed entry into graduate school, for my grandmother's move to a nursing home in Atlanta, and for a misbegotten two-month romance that unfortunately coincided with these other three concerns. It will also be remembered as the summer of The Blair Witch Project, a film which has cast a long shadow over the past year, as rumors and buzz began to circulate about the film and its directors and cast, all of whom are based nearby in Maryland. Washington is ground zero for what has become a brilliantly orchestrated cult phenomenon around a movie that cost less than an SUV and is infinitely more memorable than George Lucas' limp, lukewarm Jedi Knights. By the time the film finally opened in limited release on the sixteenth of July, I had become thoroughly immersed in Myrick and Sánchez' artful mythology, and perhaps read too many reviews and spent too much time on the website. My internalization of the arcane details on the site, which allowed for a more nuanced but perhaps less visceral viewing of the tightly edited 82 minutes of film, came at the expense of many hours that I could have spent working or packing, but I consider it time well spent. So, on July 16th I was among the first group of filmgoers in Washington to catch The Blair Witch Project at the frankly crummy Outer Circle theater. Is the film good? Yes, very good. Does it live up to the hype? I'm not certain, and I'm not the best judge of this. I had become so fascinated with the film and engrossed in the mythology that perhaps I'd too many reviews, spent too much time on the website, and already internalized too much of the storyline to be shocked at some of the details. Perhaps, in fact, I am more in love with the ideas behind the film than the film itself. There is something so brilliantly simple and elegant about a piece of fiction in which the actors don't act, the directors don't direct, and the dialogue isn't scripted. The mythology of the film, which could have become cloying sentiment of the Friday the 13th variety, is genuinely eloquent and eerily vague enough to be resonant with its audience. Is the film scary? Assuredly. What is so remarkable about The Blair Witch Project is that the fear is derived internally, rather from the outside. We don't see witches, we don't see dead bodies, we don't see gore. It's what we don't see that makes us empathize so thoroughly with Heather, Josh and Mike. The stress, the misery and the loneliness of being lost in the woods, combined with the steadily more bizarre and terrifying experiences, conspire to slowly drive the three into a state of continual near-terror. Everyone is on edge and cracking under the strain of being assailed by an unknown enemy, including the audience. There is one (well-described) moment when Heather is chasing something through a ravine, lit only dimly from behind by Josh's camera, and she lets out a horrified shriek. ""Oh my God what is that?"" We don't see anything, and the film is stronger for it. Ultimately, since we see everything through Josh, Heather and Mike's eyes, The Blair Witch Project differs from the average horror film (which makes the murderer or villain the central character). Ultimately, these are your average college kids, which makes them easy to empathize with, and their occasionally stupid and self-destructive behavior is all the more heartbreaking because we all do stupid and self-destructive things. They know arcane pop culture trivia (Cal Ripken, Gilligan's Island) but can't read maps or interpret a compass reading, and get blasted before launching into the woods. Josh's laid-back stoner façade crumbles first, Mike's stolid core tries to stabilize the three, and Heather's veneer of overconfidence and machisma collapses with horrifying finality into stark terror. There is no acting per se, so this is probably the closest we will ever get to watching three human beings completely collapse on film. The ultimate realness of the three makes this a rare film in which we genuinely care for characters even when we don't like them. The ultimate primal fear of getting lost in a dark, strange forest is something we can all identify with, and many of us have experienced under less gruesome circumstances. As the stress of that situation mounts we find ourselves put in Heather, Mike and Josh's shoes, looking through their eyes via the cameras. Heather's confession, which isolates the tears falling from one eye, is utterly gutting in its heartrending honesty. It seems strange to think of directing or cinematography when the three characters, all novices at filmmaking, are in charge of the cameras and sound. But the editing and cutting of the film are quite remarkable, particularly in a final sequence so terrifying that I won't discuss it, except to say that it ends with one searing image. Splicing 20 hours of (mostly boring, one supposes) hi-8 video and 16-mm film footage and DAT audio into a cohesive 82 minute film can't have been easy, but the amateurish filming occasionally yields moments of stunning fright and beauty. Did I say beauty? Yes. There is one scene shot in high resolution black and white through the window of their car as they drive into the woods that is simply stunning. Some of the film is completely black as they turn their cameras off in fear, but leave the DAT recorder running, and those are perversely among the most affecting moments. The final sequences are edited frenetically and disorientingly, which probably serves as an accurate reflection of the actors' own terror. The art design and sound were the understated keys to this film. In the barest and most minimal way, Myrick and Sánchez use bits of wood, twine and rocks in utterly ingenious ways to create the impression of an entire forest suffused with an evil presence. It's brilliant. They create pure terror out of a bundle of sticks tied together with a bit of cloth, the likes of which could never be equalled with a grandiose Hollywood budget. The sound is the final piece to the film's shocking success. Indeed, the soundtrack to The Blair Witch Project alone, absent the visuals, could be bloodcurdling. In the interest of authenticity and to preserve the semblence of faux-verité, there is no sound other than the voices of the actors, the ambient noise of their journey into the forest, and the horrible wails that reverberate around their campsite in the middle of the night. Other suspense and horror films rely on garish violins, spare keyboards or predictably nihilist industrial or metal to create an atmosphere of fear and tension; The Blair Witch Project's most frightening moments are audible only through the gasping breaths of the actors and the crunch of twigs being snapped. It was several weeks before the release of the film that I had the idea to make a mix tape to interpret some of the elements and moments depicted in the film. Obviously, I had to watch the movie first, but by the time I finally saw the film I was dead set on the idea. For the purposes of this little project I ended up delving into some of the realms of my collection that are usually side interests outside the broad category of pop. Pop musicians are great at selling soundtrack albums, but generally bad at scoring films, and I was trying to create an audio complement to the film rather than a marketing tie-in. (Indeed I came to find out shortly after the film was released that there is an album, called Josh's Blair Witch Mix, allegedly assembled by Joshua Leonard. His taste leans toward dour and bludgeoning metal and industrial, music too vulgar to adequately represent the chilling elegance of the film.) I relied largely on a mix of modern classical, some experimental and electronic compositions, a few pop selections, and a number of innovative multimedia and soundtrack pieces, particularly those with an Eastern European or Middle Eastern flavor for reasons that seemed more aesthetic than authenic. I was also able to rely on the superlative Blair Witch Project website for some brief audio and video segments to cut into the music. The result is a 90-minute cassette, my attempt to represent the Blair Witch Project experience on tape. Heather, Josh, and Mike, ""Off to the shack? The shanty?"" .mov file. A seemingly jaunty trio shoulder their packs, leave their car behind, and head into the woods outside Burkittsville, Maryland. David Byrne, ""Ava"" (Nu Wage Remix), from the Forestry EP. A lurching classical piece presciently remixed with jittery proto-trip-hop drums, borrowed and adapted from Byrne's 1991 theater piece The Forest. Taylor & Rifle, ""Main theme"" from the soundtrack to Amateur. A luminous orchestral piece with choral vocals, led by a spare piano line, originally from the 1995 Hal Hartley film soundtrack that also featured the Jesus Lizard and Yo La Tengo. Perfectly evokes the scene shot in high-resolution black and white through the window of their car as the three embark into the forests of rural Maryland. The Kingdom of Leisure, ""Across-the-Bow,"" from This is the New America. An echoing, swampy blues riff from the DC-based innovators of tripgrass. Heather, Josh, and Mike, ""Argument"" .au file. The three, lost and hungry, argue bitterly over their location and Heather's leadership. Peter Gabriel, ""Of These, Hope - Reprise,"" from Passion: Soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ. Peter Gabriel is perhaps the popular musician best equipped to produce a full soundtrack score, as he did for Scorcese's Last Temptation of Christ. Passion makes use of remarkable field recordings from the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, giving them a lush and overwhelmingly engrossing studio veneer. Domácí Kapela, ""Prizraky"" [Phantoms], from Nedêle. Gripping, off-putting and to Western ears, unspeakably bizarre, this Czech art-rock composition gives off the impression of Enya and a lost klezmer band trying desperately to make sense of fuzzy photocopied samizdat transcriptions of Queensryche. Heather, Josh, and Mike, ""Are you happy?"" .au file. Josh protests that he's supposed to be at work the next morning; Mike begs the two to be civil in the unpleasant circumstances. Dawn Upshaw, ""The Girl With Orange Lips,"" from The Girl With Orange Lips. >From the 1990 album of the same name, one of a lengthy series of cryptic and moving poems (by Stephan Mallarmé, Arthur Rimbaud, and others) set to brief and often jarring classical orchestration. Also features one of the most astonishing and lyrical cover photographs in my entire collection. Andie MacDowell, ""Define Violence,"" from the soundtrack to The End of Violence. Wim Wenders' soundtracks for Until the End of the World and The End of Violence were models for this project, and Andie MacDowell's drily accusatory rebuke can apply nicely here. Plays over a nice ambient piece by the film's music director, Ry Cooder. Duane Eddy, ""Trembler"" (remix), from the soundtrack to Natural Born Killers. Trent Reznor, who shows every indication of being a completely unpleasant human being, nevertheless is a remarkably ingenious manipulator of sounds and images. Nothing illustrates his gift more effectively than the jarring, hallucinatory soundtrack to Natural Born Killers, an album that conveys the message of the film far more effectively than the film itself. Eddy's rumbling bass guitar introduction is one of the moments on this tape that still makes my heart stop, even after repeated listens. Heather, Josh, and Mike, ""My God, what is that"" .mov file. Heather, sprinting through a ravine in the middle of the night, lit only from behind by the light from Josh's camera, sees something in the distance. Lauren Hoffman, ""Look Like Shit"" (4-track demo), from the A Harmless Little Kiss EP. Hoffman's numb, aching vocals and raw guitar playing are testimony to the circumstances of the song's recording and a musical journal for the strain of sleepless nights and grinding terror. One of the four musicians on this tape I'm privileged to know personally, even if only from a distance. Golden Palominos, ""Prison of the Rhythm,"" from the Prison of the Rhythm EP. Lori Carson's breathy vocals and Anton Fier's frenetic drum programming conflate sex with God with fear, which isn't quite the point of the film, but it works in context. Nine Inch Nails, ""Down In It,"" from Pretty Hate Machine. The best ""wind rushing through a moral vacuum"" noises ever made. Towering Inferno, ""Edvard Király,"" from Kaddish. Maniacal, hysterical screaming in Magyar, a thumping, ominous bass drum, and what sounds like the ghastly looped braying of some tortured donkey. It seemed apt. Andie MacDowell, ""Unintentional Prayers,"" from the soundtrack to The End of Violence. Low, ""Below and Above,"" from Long Division. By Low standards, this is a spritely little number. By anyone else's standards, Mimi vocals are icy beauty over the aching, needful simmer of Alan Sparhawk's carefully chosen guitar notes, doled out sparingly as if the band is deathly afraid that they don't have enough to reach the end of the song. Heather, ""Confession"" .mov file excerpt. An excerpt from Heather's midnight confessional. Aphex Twin, Disc One, Track 11, from Selected Ambient Works Volume II. Like sonar pinging the depths of the soul. Kronos Quartet, ""Kyrie I,"" from Early Music (Lachrymæ Antiquæ). A haunting piece of Fourteenth Century liturgy that sounds strangely of a piece with the modern Eastern European masters. The Moon Seven Times, ""My Game,"" from 7=49. Perhaps m7x's sparest moment, with Henry Frayne's ringing guitars excised in favor of a dry, thumping rhythm line that exposes every breath and quaver in Lynn Canfield's haunting vocals. Crime and the City Solution, ""Adversary,"" from the soundtrack to Until the End of the World. Perhaps the best pop-music soundtrack ever, the Wim Wenders soundtrack for Until the End of the World is a seamless exploration of minor-key dread and pre-millennial desperation. Crime and the City Solution's ""Adversary,"" a menacing and completely convincing open letter from predator to prey, is one of the film's perfect matches of music to visuals. Tama Renata, ""Screaming Pipes/Haka,"" from the soundtrack to Once Were Warriors. The Maori haka is a ritual chant and dance designed to intimidate, belittle and terrify tribal enemies on the field of battle. In Lee Tamahori's frightfully authentic and visceral South Auckland slums, the embrace of this warrior tradition is both a rallying call and a deadly siren song. Moby, ""New Dawn Fades,"" from I Like to Score. A dense, ominous and searing Joy Division cover with a darkly moving vocal from Moby himself. Forgiveness, ""Kol Nidrei,"" from The Jewish Alternative Movement: A Guide for the Perplexed. Groaning with the weight of four thousand years of sin and repentance, this interpretation of the classical Sephardi liturgical motif from the Yom Kippur service sounds like it could have been performed in a dark, dank woods itself. It's also my musical elegy for Joshua Leonard and his undisclosed but presumably dire fate. Balanescu Quartet, ""East,"" from Luminatza. A jittery chamber piece that leaps from a buzzsaw cello introduction into a bracing, cutting violin finale. Lanterna, ""Turbine,"" from Lanterna. A clattering, churning, surging instrumental from Moon Seven Times guitar wizard Henry Frayne. Heather, ""Confession"" .mov file. When The Blair Witch Project is examined in retrospect, this scene and the mindbending finale will be the landmarks that guarantee its place in cinema legend. Sugar, ""Tilted"" excerpt, from the Beaster EP. Bob Mould's tortured Jesus Christ imagery scales new heights in this swirling, anguished piece of feedback and sampled demogoguery. Kate Bush, ""Army Dreamers,"" from The Whole Story. Perhaps an atypical piece for this collection, but I find the contrast between the lilting guitar and vocal lines and the stately waltz rhythms, and the mournful lyrics, remarkably effective. This Mortal Coil, ""Fyt,"" from It'll End in Tears. A rare instrumental from Ivo-Watts and his assembled 4AD minions. Murky, lurching and resonant with dread. Nine Inch Nails, ""March of the Pigs,"" from The Downward Spiral, intercut with ""News Reporter"" .mov file. Despite the remarkable variety of noises that Trent Reznor manages to coax from his formidable arsenal of machines, instruments and computers, he's perhaps at his best when he uses silence as a weapon instead of bombast. Towering Inferno, ""The Rose II,"" from Kaddish. An otherworldly vocal in Magyar by Márta Sebastyén and an eerie poem in English over Richard Wolfson and Andy Saunder's liquid synthesizers. ""This sky will cover you when you fall down."" Loveliescrushing, ""Bones of Angels"" excerpt, from Beneath the Icy Floe: A Projekt Sampler Vol. 4. Perhaps surprisingly, the moody synthesized goth stylings of the Projekt bands didn't altogether suit this compilation, but Loveliescrushing's ghostly reverie fits here nicely. Mystery Machine, ""Pound for Pound,"" from Decadence: Nettwerk Records boxed set. It's to the credit of this innovative band from Vancouver that I can't pin down their sound as dizzying rock guitar with progressive metal leanings, blistering punk, twitching indie or soaringly anthemic. This song from the Nettwerk box set me in search of their other work immediately. Moby, ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters (edit),"" from Everything is Wrong. Perhaps the most stunning of Moby's richly orchestrated keyboard pieces, this staggeringly beautiful eight minute piece has also found a home on the soundtrack to Heat and in a range of additional contexts. Lisa Germano, ""...callin',"" from On the Way Down from the Moon Palace. Perhaps it's the optimist in me that reached for a vaguely elegaic minute-long violin and guitar piece to close this album, promising a gentler end than Heather, Josh and Mike ever found.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"If nothing else, 1999 will be remembered as the year in which the internet became a vital marketing tool for films. A case in point is The Blair Witch Project, the ultra low budget independent film that has become a runaway box office hit in the States, out grossing far more polished, expensive studio productions. For months now we have been bombarded, via the internet, with plenty of hype surrounding the film, preparing us for how scary it is, and informing us that audiences have found the jerky hand held camera work so unsettling that many have been rushing from the cinema to be physically sick. And the web has also been used to tell the back story about the two hundred year old legend of the so-called Blair Witch, who lives in the backwoods of upstate Maryland. The site also fills in the background information concerning the three student film makers who disappeared, presumed murdered while making a film on the popular legend. Many people actually believe that this is a documentary, compiled from the recently unearthed footage shot by the three missing film makers. Tyro film makers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez effectively create an unsettling atmosphere, and they certainly play on the audiences' fears and expectations beautifully. The film is shot using a combination of hand held video and 16mm film. The hand held camera work is not as unsettling as the massive publicity campaign would have it, and indeed much of the cinematography here seems deliberately amateurish, which adds to the overall effect. The film follows three students - Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams - as they set out to record a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. As the three become hopelessly lost in the woods, hysteria sets in, and they quickly turn on one another, blaming each other for their predicament. These scenes are the most effective and unsettling, as they establish a growing air of unease that is fed by paranoia and distrust. At night while they try to sleep, the three are disturbed by the night time sounds of the forest, which further unhinges them. Are they imagining things? Or has their belief in the legend of the witch made them unusually jumpy? Heather, the project's director and narrator, and the dominant force behind the three tyro film makers' journey, is also one of the most irritating and annoying characters. As her shrill voice unleashes another tirade against her two male colleagues, many within the audience would gladly feel like throttling her. Most of the dialogue is also unscripted, giving the whole film a natural and spontaneous atmosphere, that further adds to the illusion of reality. The Blair Witch Project is easily the most cleverly marketed film of the decade (century?), but it is by no means the scariest! Only the more impressionable and susceptible younger audiences may find any thing remotely scary and disturbing about the whole thing. Rather, this is a cynical triumph of style and hype over substance. You have been warned! **1/2 greg king http://www.netau.com.au/gregking The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"If you¹ve been paying attention to the media frenzy that is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and who hasn¹t, you know the story and you know it¹s pure dramatization. Needless to say, though, watching what has been committed to tape, one gets the undeniable impression the events are veritable: three students take hand- helds into the woods, filming a school project about the myth of a local witch, and get lost. No biggie, as the put-upon leader of their crew, Heather, states rationally, ""It¹s hard to get lost in America, and it¹s harder to stay lost."" What starts out fun and games, so to speak, amongst friends (correct ""Gilligan¹s Island"" vernacular; Heather¹s mishap with a pair of wet shoes) quickly becomes something more serious. Rations dwindle, their only map disappears, and camaraderie gradually disintegrates into bickering, nicotine jonesing and total disorientation. They set up camp, several times too often, and wake up to vague but ominous noises just in the distance. And, that¹s the ingenious thing of the film: the heard, yet unseen, proves to be a lot more terrifying. Because, try as you may to put what¹s going on into perspective (twigs snap.. probably a small animal), you still don¹t know for certain. And, because there is little light for assistance, you can either stay in one place very quietly and pray, or make a run for it in the pitch black and take your chances. During Heather¹s emotionally-draining private confessional for the camera, she sums this experience up quite nicely: ""I¹m afraid to close my eyes, and I¹m afraid to open them."" What¹s also great about the film is its budget. The point of view footage is antsy, because the actors get antsy and don¹t know exactly where to look or where they¹re going in the heat of apparent pursuit. I think BLAIR WITCH will play even better on the small screen, because of its aspect ratio and the likelihood of a more quiet environment; occasionally, I was unable to hear what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat- clearing and squeaky seats, and it bugged me immensely. There is no special effects work, no computer-generated anything, and mostly no gory close-ups (save for a set of teeth), which gives the film a great deal of authenticity. And, what I like most is the eerie conclusion; that last scene, in an abandoned, dilapidated house, is nerve-wracking and more than a little disturbing. The collective opinion circulating the net at present is that this scene is too quick, and the film ends rather abruptly. Which is true, but that¹s the point. It is Heather¹s fear and despondence, come to the breaking point. After being in the woods for so long, and not knowing what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment ­ whether she, or her friends, would make it ­ she and Mike arrive at one last spot, maze-like and frustrating, and in an instant it¹s all over. You leave with questions, and want to talk about what you¹ve just witnessed with as many people as you can get it in a room. Movies that can put you there have done their job; real, or fake (forget the whole is-it-a-sham-or-not business, already). That final image ­ you know the one ­ is cryptic and haunting. I wanted more scenes at night, with ­ not _clearer_ sounds, but I don¹t know, more of them. Even greater a building of exhaustion and fear. The film does not quite go the psychological distance, but it¹s close. Also, the arguing goes on a little much for my taste (one fight, over the whereabouts of the map, turns especially shrill), though such carrying-on is understand- able, circumstances considered. ""Scary as hell"" no. Creepy, yes. Effective, brilliantly- conceived and executed, and performed with all the conviction in the world so that even if we doubt what we¹re seeing is real, suspension of disbelief is never an issue: _oh yeah_.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"As I sit in front of the glowing screen in this pre-dawn hour thinking about this film, everything around me feels eerie. The usually-comforting piles of clutter and artifacts that fill my office are alien. When my cat walks across the keyboard causing me to delete his gibberish, it's not an annoyance, it's foreboding. I walk to into the living room and put on some Jimmy Buffett -- the least frightening music I can think of. It doesn't work. There's still a strange atmosphere haunting the house. This is the power of ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's been two days since I saw the movie and the reaction remains. Three student filmmakers wander off into a Maryland forest in October 1994 to film a documentary about the Blair witch, a local piece of folklore. They disappear, never to be found. A year later, anthropology students discover a duffel bag containing film and video cassettes buried under a 100 year-old cabin deep in the woods. The movie we see is the found footage. Knowledgeable members of the audience know this is all fake. The actors playing the students are still alive. The film team never existed. None of them were lost or killed. The footage is a combination of the black and white 16mm supposedly filmed for the documentary and video shot for a ""Making Of"" feature. Much of it has the appearance of what you get when you take a camcorder out for the day. Scenes are poorly lighted. Subjects are out of frame. Often it's difficult to make out what you are seeing or hearing. It's the most unprofessional film cinematography ever seen on the big screen. And possibly the most realistic. The amateur quality is what makes it work. Like even the worst home movies or old grainy 8mm porn films, there's a fascination because there's something real going on. It's as if you are eavesdropping on someone's life. No matter how much they try, high production values can never accomplish this. The very nature of the unprofessionalism erases the barrier between the audience and the film. Anyone who has spent a few nights in the woods knows the fear of the night unknowns that creeps into your mind at times. Usually when I'm camping, it's with a large group of ten to a few hundred people. There's always weirdness, but I have an idea of what most of it is. On the occasions when there's only been two or three of us, it's a different matter. Unidentifiable sounds come from outside the tent and you know there's _something_ going on out there. In the film, some of the ""somethings"" can be attributed, as you do when out there at night, to animal activity. But some of them decidedly can not. After the students are lost, they hear disembodied voices. They awaken one morning to find piles of rocks outside their tent. The night scenes never show us anything beyond the few feet the lights shine. Whatever is there, is beyond their -- and our -- knowing. Some of the most frightening scenes are from the camcorder left on as they run helter-skelter through the forest in the dark. All we see are branches brushing past the lens. All we hear are panting and a few excited words. It's chilling. The three actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams) use their real names in the film and are completely convincing as people you might run into walking down the street. Ordinary people scared out of their wits. The movie has some flaws. We don't learn enough about the Blair witch. When I left the theater, I felt disappointed in the last two minutes. Too much was neatly wrapped up and I thought it would have been better had the film ended earlier. But days later, the final five seconds stay with me. It's more terrifying now than it was then. Although the film is undeniably ground-breaking, it's unlikely we're going to see a lot of movies copying it as is the tradition. It's a concept that can't work more than once or twice. In some ways it's a one-trick pony. But it's a remarkable trick. (Michael Redman has written this column for 24 years and during that time has seen a lot of weird things in the woods at night.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The following review is property of MOVIE CRITICISM FOR THE RETARDED and cannot be quoted or referenced without proper credit. For more information, go to the homepage at http://www.homestead.com/mc4tr First off, a personal note. This is the first film I've reviewed in retarded mode in a year and a half, since the video store where the concept was born shut its doors. So if this sucks, bear with me, I'm just trying to be like Stella and get my groove back. The Blair Witch Project. Great fuckin' movie. You heard it here. I don't care how much buzz and hype is going around, ther is no room for dissenting opinion in this matter. Blair Witch is amazing. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're wrong. There's no debating it. Why, you ask? Because this is the scariest movie I've seen since Kubrick's THE SHINING. Because the filmmaking style is so bold. Because you are literally part of the action. If you read my essay ARTHOUSE MOVIES IN FRATHOUSE THEATERS, you know about the conditions that I saw the film in. People threw shit at the screen, talked during the whole thing, and basically booed the film. These people failed to grasp the whole intent of the film. I think I heard someone say ""You didn't even get to see the witch!"" as if that were a disappointing issue. I just wanted to grab the fucker's neck and yell ""OF COURSE you didn't see the fucking witch! THAT WAS THE POINT!"" Here's some perspective for you. Blair witch was made for about $25,000. That's roughly one one-thousandth of what a typical Hollywood movie costs to make as a bare minimum. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and THE HAUNTING probably cost way more, and neither one of them could hope to achieve what this film did so well. So with $25,000, it's not like we're going to see any amazing special effects. No computer generated images, no elaborate costumes or make-up jobs, no explosions, no elaborate sets. We get woods, three scared people, and a whole bunch of frightening sound effects. We don't HAVE to see the witch. We don't HAVE to have everything spoon-fed to us. It's a super-fucking-frightening experience because you are there, in those woods, seeing and hearing what the actors do. Remember the old adage that man's greatest fear is the fear of the unknown? Well finally that idea is captured on film. After decades of being shoveled crappy horror movies where we are supposed to be frightened by actually seeing the antagonist, some people haven't grasped that that's not what's scary. The human psyche is a much more tender spot to fuck with than the eyes. I was nervous as shit after the trio realized they were lost, and I wan't even sure why. Being lost in the woods is a scary thing. Being in the woods at night is even scarier, especially when there's not a town for miles to provide any light. EVERY noise seems like an explosion. EVERYTHING is scary in that situation, so it's especially scary when there's some weird shit going on like piles of stones arranged around your tent and Christian Death symbols hanging from trees. You don't know if it's bears or crazy rednecks or child-murdering witches, and you don't care. You know what really scared the shite out of me? The scenes where they turned the camera off and you only had the audio from the DAT. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I felt uneasy in a movie theater. I was actually releived when I realized that day had broken again. Yeah, I knew that the characters would all be dead by the end, but none of that mattered. I was there. I was in that tent. I was walking along with Heather and Mike and Josh. That's how powerful the use of POV in the film was. I wasn't just concerned for the lives of the characters, I was concerned for my own life. And another beautiful thing about this film is that you can tell someone everything about it and not spoil it for them. It isn't even important that they all die. You know they're gonna bite the big chicken in the sky by the end. You can tell basically all the little details to everyone and not ruin the movie for them. It's the execution of the film that matters. It's all the little quirks involving the characters and their reactions to the environment. It's the way the two mediums of Hi-8 video and 16mm black and white are alternated to give you two different views of what's going on...the reality of the video camera transposed with the control aspect of the 16mm. There's SO much going for this film and the way it jars you emotionally that I could talk for hours. And you know what's interesting? As great as this movie is in the theater, it's going to be even better on video, because the jerky-cam won't be quite as dramatic, and you won't have the comfort of 500 strangers nearby to lessen your fear. Some people didn't find it scary. Too bad. I pity them, because they are failing to grasp what true fear is all about. So for you people, have fun watching the latest slasher films with a singly named psycopath that keeps on magically rising from the dead. Keep on admiring Jennifer Love Hewitt and her predictable getways from the forces of evil. Enjoy the newest hack job by the creator of Dawson's Creek who needs Wes Craven to make anything amount to less than a 2 hour sack of steaming shit. That stuff's fun, but it's not scary. The only thing scary about it is that people will continue to pack theaters to see it. As for me, I'm gonna wrap up and check out blairwitch.com to involve myself in the backstory a bit more and suspend my disbelief a whole lot. And then I might just see THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT again.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Rating: *** (out of ****) Artisan Entertainment / 1:27 / 1999 / R (language, intensity) Cast: Heather Donahue; Michael Williams; Joshua Leonard Director: Daniel Myrick; Eduardo Sanchez Screenplay: Daniel Myrick; Eduardo Sanchez In a day when cities never sleep and the crime rates in them soar, the woods would seem to offer nature's last refuge, a simple, reassuring solace from the hectic hustle and bustle of the real world. But along comes ""The Blair Witch Project,"" this year's Little Movie That Could, to promptly and potently shoot that notion out of the water. If ""Blair Witch"" breaks out - and robust pre-release buzz certainly suggests that it will - expect weekend camping trips to become a thing of the past. You won't be able to sleep soundly in your own bed. Kiss the wilderness goodbye forever. An exercise in mounting dread set in the murky ""Black Hills"" of Maryland, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the hot ticket at this year's Sundance Film Festival, inspiring additional screenings and even a studio bidding war as a result of the blazingly positive word-of-mouth - raves that must have blindsided the first-time filmmakers of this impressive independent feature. They are Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, and their directorial debut - cleverly spun as if the story actually happened and shot on 16mm and home video to further hit the horror home - is clearly one to remember. As if you'll be able to forget it. Know this going in - that ""Blair Witch"" is a purely fictional creation - and the impact is perhaps lessened a bit; to make up for any potential viewing drawbacks, just assure friends that the events displayed here are factual, drag them along and watch them squirm. Which isn't to say that those in the know won't get a mean case of ""Witch"" willies - the three main performers in Blair are so authentic that it's easy to believe in the on-screen dread they expertly convey. Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard never strike false notes as student filmmakers interviewing the yokels and exploring the terrain of Frederick County in their quest to document the existence of a local urban legend. Unfortunately for them, their trek into the forest takes exceedingly nasty turns - the less said of which the better. Worth noting: The movie's concise mythology might leave you craving more. As tension slowly, steadily builds over ""Blair Witch""'s 87-minute run, disagreements and skirmishes amongst the trio grow in both number and anxiety, often escalating to shouting matches studded with various expletives. Realistic, yes, and also redundant. But once ""Project"" kicks into high gear for its final third - a non-stop stomach-churner - there's little time for the cast to catch their breath enough to scream, let alone swear. Even with this intense noise-making, genre fans expecting an all-out splatterfest are sure to be disappointed: ""The Blair Witch Project,"" proudly respecting the power of the unseen, assaults the mind with psychological terror instead of the eyes with explicit gore. Following suit, Myrick and Sanchez also keep their ghastly antagonist completely in viewers' imaginations for the duration of the film. Whether it's intentional or merely a side effect of ""Blair Witch""'s shoestring budget, this game of no-show is a smart, sensical move - and the key to the movie's scary success. © 1999 Jamie Peck E-mail: jpeck1@gl.umbc.edu Visit The Reel Deal Online: http://www.gl.umbc.edu/~jpeck1/ ""The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis' genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything else."" -Roger Ebert on ""Color of Night"" The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"After being a little bit seduced by the advance buzz for the low-budget Sundance indie ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I entered the theater expecting to see one of the scariest movies ever made. And I did experience moments of sheer terror--especially toward the film's end--but overall it isn't all that scary, although it is extremely unsettling. To my mind, this movie doesn't fit neatly into the horror genre category--it's more of a psychological thriller. What affected me even more intensely than the undercurrent of horror in the film was the tension that continued to build slowly throughout, culminating when the pressures of being hopelessly lost in the woods (and possibly hunted) cause the sanity of the characters to slowly start to snap. In some ways, I found ""The Blair Witch Project"" reminiscent of the 1972 adventure/thriller ""Deliverance,"" although that film is stylistically quite different. Employing a cinema verite style, ""The Blair Witch Project"" tells the tale of a three-person student film crew that went out to the woods near Burkittsville (formerly Blair), Maryland, in 1994 to make a documentary about the legend of a local witch. The film opens with stark letters on a black background, stating that their footage was found a year after their disappearance and comprises what we are about to see. At the beginning, the students laugh and joke in an easy, relaxed manner. But as things go fatally wrong during the creation of their documentary, their mental and physical condition progressively erodes, causing them to become brittle and start to turn on each other. The gradual deterioration of the film crew's state of mind is heartbreaking. Particularly devastating is the degeneration of the documentary's plucky director. Finally realizing that they will probably not get out alive, she films an apology to her own parents and those of the crew in the movie's most memorable scene. Adding to the realistic nature of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick, who co-wrote and co- directed the film, make extensive use of improvisation in collaboration with their actors, resulting in scenes that seem natural and uncontrived. The first names of the characters are the same as those of the actors who portray them. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the documentary's director; Michael (Michael Williams) the sound man, and Joshua (Joshua Leonard) the cameraman. The acting is so convincing that at times I had to remind myself that this was fiction rather than fact and that these were actors rather than the characters they portrayed. I found this reminiscent of the films of John Cassavetes--one of the pioneers of independent filmmaking--who also made extensive use of improvisation. >From its uncomplicated premise to its stark visual style, much of the film's impact stems from its simplicity, and this is particularly true of the film's stunning cinematography. While emulating the look and feel of a student documentary production, it also manages to slyly conceal a slow-release emotional wallop cleverly hidden in its seemingly naive delivery. The vertiginous, jerky hand-held camera work, along with the constant intermixing of film stock--much of it grainy and often shot from disorienting, oblique angles--create a dizzying visual edge. This cleverly complements the mood of uncertainty, bewilderment, dread, and ever-encroaching doom that permeates the movie. In ""The Blair Witch Project,"" imagination is the ultimate special effect. One of the most daring aspects of the camera work is that it sometimes drops down to velvet black; there is nothing to be seen, except for what exists in the audience's imagination. These moments of absolute darkness are extremely disturbing because your mind wraps itself around the ambiguity, conjuring the rest out of whatever happens to lurk in your subconscious. I think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is well worth seeing, although it probably won't meet most people's expectations of what a horror film should be. Despite a meager budget, Sanchez and Myrick have created a remarkably original, vividly realistic movie that reaches down deep into the personal and psychological aspects of fear. It's a film that shows what can happen when talented independent filmmakers follow their creative vision without compromise.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"by Curtis Edmonds -- blueduck@hsbr.org I was talking with one of my reformed slacker friends about the movie scene in Austin, when the subject of Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn) came up. ""He's a great guy,"" I was told. ""We were pretty good friends when we were both living in Austin."" I asked, ""Is it true that he got the money to film El Mariachi at Pharmaco?"" Pharmaco, by the way, is (or was, they've renamed it) a pharmaceutical research company that pays impoverished University of Texas students to serve as guinea pigs in drug research. If you know that story, you probably know the one about how Harvey Keitel got hold of the script for Reservoir Dogs and gave Quentin Tarantino a hand in finding the money to shoot the film with real actors instead of his video-store pals. Stories like these are to Generation X what the story of Lana Turner getting discovered at the soda fountain were to an earlier generation. Being an independent film director/producer/writer is today what being a movie star was to kids in the Forties, or what being a rock star was to kids in the Sixties. It is the coolest thing you could ever hope to be. (This side of playing quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, of course.) The real legend of The Blair Witch Project has nothing to do with what may or may not be lurking in the Maryland woods. It has to do with novice filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, and how they turned a few thousand dollars and a few thousand feet of 16mm footage into the multimillion dollar blockbuster that's got everyone talking this summer. The story's familiar to anyone who's caught any part of the tremendous buzz about this movie; directors Myrick and Sanchez recruited three actors, equipped them with cameras and sent them into the woods for eight days with little more than a promise that it might get a little scary for them alone out there. Combine this utterly unconventional approach to moviemaking with the unprecedented positive word-of-mouth that the movie received on the festival circuit and on the Internet, and it's the sort of story that would make any aspiring wannabe director sick with envy. The Blair Witch Project itself isn't as compelling as the story of how the movie was made, but it's not far behind. It's a taut, scary horror thriller, one of the best of an increasingly bad lot of 1999 movies. (It's a bit too early to tap as an Oscar contender, but one wishes Oscar would have a Rookie of the Year category.) It begins in the most matter-of-fact way possible, with the now-famous caption: ""In October of 1994, three student film makers disappeared in the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland. One year later, their footage was found."" And that's it. No fancy opening sequence, no list of casting directors or assistant executive producers, nothing to break the verisimilitude that all this footage was shot by three kids wandering around in the forest. (Which most of it was.) The three kids are Heather, Josh, and Mike, played by Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams. They've checked out a couple of cameras and an audio recorder from school, and they're on their way to the town of Burkittesville (formerly Blair, we're told) to shoot some location scenes for a documentary on the local legend, whatever it is. One of the movie's little conceits is that the trio carries two cameras for two different purposes. The actual scenes that they're going to use in the documentary are shot in black-and-white on a 16mm movie camera. They're also carrying along some sort of color camcorder that they mostly use to goof off with. So, the footage of Heather speaking to the camera in the town graveyard is in black-and-white, and the footage of the cast relaxing in the authentically cheesy motel room afterward is in color. This conceit defines the look of the movie in three important ways. First, film from the two cameras is interwoven together, so the movie switches back and forth from B&W to color more often than the shuttle bus that runs between Kansas and Oz. Since both cameras are hand-held most of the time, the whole movie is herky- jerky enough to cause motion sickness in some viewers. And since cameras need light to operate, there are a lot of scenes that take place either in total blackness or in the eerie glow of a flashlight. But the look of the movie isn't what you'll remember, isn't what will keep you up until the wee hours of the morning. The hyperbole about The Blair Witch Project being the scariest movie ever aside, this is a movie that will scare you. It may not scare you sitting in the theater. (Myself, I didn't think I was all that scared, although it was comforting to have an aisle seat just in case things got a little too scary.) But there are scenes that will stick in your memory, that will haunt you at odd moments when you're alone in your car or trying to get to sleep or when you hear a strange noise in the middle of the night. The Blair Witch Project does not rely on surprise or gore, the two mainstays of the Hollywood slasher movie. Instead, it uses the rules of the campfire ghost story. Myrick and Sanchez know that fear is contagious, and they scare their actors silly, knowing that they will transmit the fear to each other and to the audience. They also know that they don't need to show a lot of really scary stuff in the movie, just set up a scary situation and let the mind fill in the blanks. (Next time you get the chance to tell a ghost story at a campfire out in the woods to a group of kids that hasn't seen the movie, tell the story of the Blair Witch and see what happens.) But The Blair Witch Project is more than just a spooky ghost story, thanks to the work of actors Heather, Mike, and Josh. There are some drawbacks to their performance. They're a bunch of Generation X twits, for one thing. They wear plaid flannel shirts and whine and moan a lot. Like Tarantino characters, they seem to have only two modes of conversation, obscenity and pop culture references. (""Did you ever see Deliverance?"" one of them asks as they make their way into the woods.) They're highly dependent on emotion. As they wander through the woods with only a compass, trying to figure out which direction civilization lies, one of them asks, ""How does east feel?"" The ordeal of being lost in the woods drains them emotionally to the point that they have to stop walking and have a good cry every once in a while. (I kept imagining what would happen if you placed the squad from Saving Private Ryan in a similar situation, after Normandy, seeing piles of rocks and twigs might not be so bad.) But these are minor quibbles. The cast does a great, intense, powerful job. There's an unfakable genuineness and sincerity to their performances. We're not just being told that they're cold and hungry and scared, we feel it along with them (the hungry part, especially, given how much popcorn costs these days). Their slow, linear descent into the nether world of psychological disintegration is much scarier than the things that go bump in the night. Donahue is outstanding, taking a part that could have been nothing more than a Jamie Lee Curtis scream queen role and taking it to the next level. The movie's signature scene is hers, and her brittle, tense, unblinking delivery will stay with you. So will the last scenes of the movie, filmed in this, um... well... place.... with this stuff everywhere... and... well, I could describe it, but you'll want to see it for yourself without me spoiling it. One of the best things about The Blair Witch Project is that even though we know (or think we know) that Josh, Heather and Mike are doomed, we're still rooting for them all the way, hoping that they'll find their car and get back home so Josh can call his girlfriend and so Heather can to turn in the camera equipment on time. And as we root for them, we're also rooting for Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the young geniuses who started with nothing but managed to spin straw (and twigs, and rocks, and slime) into gold. Box office aside, the real success of The Blair Witch Project will be the hope and inspiration it will give to the next generation of filmmakers, actors, and screenwriters seeking to become the coolest thing you can ever hope to be.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"ARTISEN ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS A HAXAN FILM PRODUCTION A FILM BY DANIEL MYRICK & EDUARDO SÁNCHEX ""THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"" HEATHER DONAHUE MICHAEL C. WILLIAMS JOSHUA LEONARD ORIGINAL MUSIC BY TONY CORA EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: KEVIN J. FOXE, BOB EICK CINEMATOGRAPHY BY NEAL FREDERICKS PRODUCED BY ROBIN COWIE & GREGG HALE EDITED, WRITTEN & DIRECTED BY DANIEL MYRICK AND EDUARDO SÁNCHEZ Never underestimate the gullibility of the American Psyche. We want our ghosts. We need our government cover-ups and conspiracies. We lust for an Extraterrestrial implant. And a lot of us really expect to win the lottery. From this collective wanting of something unique and otherworldly, comes the current flavor of the month ""The Blair Witch Project"", a marvelously adept film representation of the old shell game. Much hype and effort has gone into creating the ""legend"" surrounding this film. There are individuals who earnestly believe in the story of three film students who have mysteriously disappeared. But for all the attentive hyperbole and inventiveness, what does the movie have to offer. That is an interesting question, because without the hype or the backstory (or the ingenious marketing strategy), 'The Blair Witch Project' would not be as successful at raising the hackles of most of it's viewers. The film opens on a black screen. Fading up is the (now) famous tagline for the film: In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. One year later, their footage was found. With what has been seen before in the news reports about the film and the mock documentary, this opening credit manages to create an air of foreboding. The film is basically a reconstruction from the discovered Video, Film and Audio recordings of Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard who have left home for Burkittesville, Maryland to shoot a short documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. We see some interesting interviews with some of the locals of Burkittesville, talking about the legend and the history of the curse. As the three filmmakers march into the woods, tensions begin to mount. Being ill prepared for any real camping experience, the three young people are soon lost and bickering amongst themselves. This slowly escalates into terror, as during the nights they are wakened by strange noises, that seems to emanate from all around them. As their terror and anxiety grows, Heather Donahue tries valiantly to remain in control of the small group. Unfortunately, her growing self-doubt and insecurity is fuels by the constant bickering from both Joshua Leonard and (especially) Michael Williams. When they loss (?!) their map, all reason is lost. The students wander aimlessly in circles, returning to the same campsite that they had left earlier that morning. That night after much noise and chasing of unseen visitors, Joshua disappears. Now Heather is seized with fear. Michael now has to serve as the leader, something he seems suddenly capable of doing. Again, more noises during the night, followed by the discovery of a strange totem left outside of their tent, which is tied together with remnants of Joshua's clothing. Concealed inside are the visual remains of something possibly human, possibly animal. Now all hope expires as Heather has a breakdown, confessing to her video camera that she is responsible for what has happened. The film climaxes with the discovery of an abandoned house, it's interior walls covered with the dirty (bloody?) handprints of children. What ""The Blair Witch Project"" has managed to do, with no lack of inventiveness, is to re-invent the marketing champagne for movies. Since the development of the Internet, motion picture companies had used the World Wide Web as another marketing tool. You can download trailers and bios of your favorite stars and view behind the scene video clips from any number of movies. What has happened with the ""Blair Witch"" is the creation of an advertisement that seems not to be an advertisement. The film in and of itself is remarkably well done, in an amateurish cinema verité method. Unfortunately, the constant videotape use calls into question the rational of the participants. Why would you continue filming yourself washing your hand in a stream to remove the blood from it, as it revolts you. Most people would at least put the camera down (or drop it). But not Heather, she is the consummate filmmaker. Willing to die (literally) for her art. The use of the actors themselves as the camera men is not so revolutionary, having been used to frightening effect in the little seen film ""THE LAST BROADCAST"" (1998). The mock documentary style has been a staple of Italian gore/cannibal films since the early 70's. But what makes the 'Blair Witch' so involuntary is that there seems to be no real direction of the actors. One does buy into the mythology after a while, and being so immersed in this universe, can help but be dragged along. As a horror film, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is unique in that at a time when prosthetic effects and cosmetics have become so realistic, this film eschews them in favor of the old Val Lewton approach. What you don't see is psychologically more terrifying than anything visual. Your imagination can fill in the blanks much more clearly than any effects master could. The Mise-En-Scéne of the woods decorated with the totems hanging from every branch is remarkably foreboding, giving the viewer a level of unease that cannot be easily shaken off. Also the music by Tony Cora is along the lines of the subtle tones and noises used in Tobe Hooper's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', (another film that plumped the psychological well for it's effectiveness) Now, let's get one thing straight. No one really died here. In fact Michael Williams is currently working on another film (a big budget item). Heather has also been cast in another project. These young people are professional actors. The mythology of the 'Blair Witch' is a complete fabrication. This is the stuff of urban legends. We've all heard stories of headless ghosts wandering through wooden glades, or businesses built on possible Indian (or Spanish) burial ground. All nice little stories to help the kids get a poor night's sleep. What Directors Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sánchez have done here is create a marvelously deft psychological test for the masses. Without the attentive mythology and aggressive hype, their film would not be anywhere near as accessible or successful. On it's own; the film is painfully slow. There is far too much 'shaky cam' work being done, giving many viewers a disorienting experience. For the most part this works in raising expectations from the viewers that something is about to happen. The film is riff with false starts. While the editing is remarkable efficient, it sometimes works against itself, as whenever we jump from video to 16 millimeter film and back within a short scene. But again, this has the desired neurological effect of persuading the viewer. The film almost becomes an inkblot or Thematic Apperception Test with it's continual viewing of the woods, especially at night when the lack of light and preponderance of shadow creates it's own images. Most interesting of all is that the film is presented in an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, basically the same ratio as your television set. This gives the film another level of psychological immediacy, making the film seem real. We're used to seeing films projected on a big, wide screen. This film instead creates a field of view that is limited from the start, as the peripheral area of the screen is blank. Whether this film will work as well on home video is a question that waits to be answered. This is a hard film to review. One cannot separate the promotion of the film from the film itself. They are so intertwined with one another as to be symbiotic, feeding off of each other. It will be interesting to see the promotion that is used to market the film's video release. So on a scale of one to five stars, ""The Blair Witch Project"" gets two ratings. The film itself gets only 2½. But the promotion, mythology and film together get a 4. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not so much a film, as it is what the title really implies. It is a PROJECT! Copyright © 1999 R. L.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Lest we forget, Deliverance was 1972. Six years later The Hills Have Eyes. Two decades later they still do. And James Dickey's backwoods have always been there in the unconscious, waiting. What The Blair Witch Project does is take us back to those woods, and then leave us there with three film students--Josh(ua Leonard), Mic(hael Williams), and Heather (Donahue)--there to document the Blair Witch Legend, get in and get out. But, as the opening title card informs, they never make it out, meaning that during the next 80-odd minutes the issue isn't Will they die, but How will they die? Which is quite a gamble for independents Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, dramatically speaking. But they make it pay. Before the opening sequence is even over, narrative matters have ceased to intrude. This thanks to genre--not horror, but documentary: they idea that anything can happen, and did. But the documentary brings with it its own set of conventions, one of which is that the filmmaker is able to keep and objective distance from the subject. Which is to say the filmmaker doesn't believe. Which, conveniently enough, is the first mistake in any horror film. The second is to get suddenly curious. Here, Myrick and Sanchez provide that tragic curiosity via documentary interest, and then collapse any and all objective distance Josh and Mike and Heather might have had from the Blair Witch Legend by making them subject to it. Which is exactly the kind of sophisticated reversal so often absent from horror. All the same though, this is a horror movie. Josh Mike and Heather do make all the typical mistakes--splitting up, with-holding information, turning on each other, etc--and they do often choose, as Josh says, to stay and record instead of help, but still, it never quite becomes formulaic. And it's not just about cinematography, presentation, improvised lines, so-called method-filmmaking. It's about stumbling deeper and deeper into the darkness. The Blair Witch Project draws upon our most primal fear--the unseen presence. The strongest scenes in it aren't the ones with the leaves rushing by and the noises just beyond the frame, they're the ones where the screen is black, and all we have to gon on is audio whispers. The weakest points perhaps all occur in the first 15 minutes, where Myrick and Sanchez had to edit this raw footage together in a back and forth manner, so as to firmly establish that everything we're seeing is through the camera of a crewmember. A necessary evil, perhaps, in the absence of voice-overs or scores or potential soundtracks we're trained to cue into. Does The Blair Witch Project intend to retrain us, though? Perhaps. If we pay attention. First, however, it just disturbs us at a fundamental level, and then, by foregoing the Hollywood ending, it doesn't take that disturbance away. Suddenly, American cinema isn't so American anymore.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project was overhyped. And like most overhyped films, it was a major disappointment for me. It was praised as the scariest movie to be made since ""The Shining"" or ""Halloween"" or whatever, yadda yadda yadda, but in the end it was just a justifiably glorified experiment in independent film making. Creative? Yes. Well-acted? Yes. Laudable? That too. But scary? No. Not in the way it promised to be. It might be more appropriate for viewing at a quiet, private gathering in your home, rather than with a bunch of rowdy movie- goers who are just waiting to be scared. I have to admit, the first five minutes really hooked me, because this was the first time we've actually seen movie actors look really crappy (i.e., realistic) on screen. No, I'm joking, but the point is we don't usually see character exposition like this, from the third person narrative to the first person, from hand-held video camera (documentary of the film makers themselves) to the actual black-and-white documentary of ""The Blair Witch."" It was like watching a family video on screen, it was an unprecedented blurring of the line between reality and fiction. Even the taglines for the film were cagey: they left people wondering whether this film that they were going to see was a real documentary, a fake one, a film containing documentary footage, or a documentary containing film footage. Yes, you would be as confused as I were, unless you're one of those people who read up everything you could on this film and was prepared, sort of. Not even ""The Real World"" or ""Cops"" achieved this kind of reality, which makes it all the more amazing because ""Blair"" is actually fictitious. I must marvel at the lengths the film makers had to have gone though to accomplish this feat . . . but did we *really* need to see an hour and a half of it before getting to the point? We knew these people were going to die, we knew that this time, the good guys weren't going to survive. The suspense just didn't work anymore when everyone was waiting to see how these characters would die. ""Blair"" tried to make the supposed witch scary by having her described by commonfolk, by I think this was the witch's undoing. These people were too matter-of-fact; they spoke of the legends as if they were like any other small town stories. A hairy old woman with a shawl? Whatever. And why did kill? That was never explained either. The pile of rocks, the man-shaped twigs, the goo on Josh's ""stuff."" None of these were explained. If there were any scary images being conjured up in my head, they were pretty much diffused by the frequent switches between daylight and night time and the non-stop bickering between the characters, yeah, it's hilarious, and definitely much better than seeing people screaming their heads off and spouting off stupid lines, but it ruins the mood. The passionate will cry that we are all spoiled by special effects, that we need artificiality and contrivance to scare us. At this point I'm afraid that I must concede their statements to be at least partially true. Who wants reality when we can experience it first-hand? It's a pity, really. If only the rest of the film were more like the last five or ten minutes: the desperate, haunting, and truly unnerving end to our three (or the two left) intrepid documentators. To me, that was the film's saving grace. If not for the ending (which gave me major chills when later that night I had to be alone in a big house: I kept imagining shadowy figures facing the corners of the walls), I would've walked off with a far worse impression of ""Blair."" I'm fond of it, and I admire it, but I wish it had lived up to expectations. The truth is I now see this film as an aborted genius, a glimpse at what might have been a true milestone in the horror genre.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"In October of 1994, three student filmmakers began work on a documentary about the Blair Witch, a creature of urban legend (ala Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster) which supposedly lives in the woods outside Burkittsville, Maryland. Laughing at these children's tales, which many of the townsfolk still believed, the trio entered the woods in search of material for their 'Blair Witch project.' But their story did not vanish along with them: nearly a year after their disappearance, their film was found by a group of archaeology students from a nearby university. Using this footage, and only this footage, filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez have pieced together an 88-minute account of the trio's last days, revealing an intimate portrait of an expedition gone horribly wrong. It's a raw, heartwrenching tale, drenched in slowly mounting paranoia and madness. Through their own camera lenses, we witness the group's skyrocketing sense of desperation, as well as their growing alienation from one another. Things go wrong-- major things, all of which culminate in their inability to escape from the mysterious entity (or entities) quietly stalking them in the darkness. There's something cathartic about fear--a certain trait which allows us to put our own lives into perspective. Things could always be worse, horror movies assure us. Many films have attempted to capatilize on our love and need for terror over the years-- stories like Jaws, The Exorcist, Friday the 13th, The Shining, and hundreds more. Often these movies succeed in giving us a harmless case of nighttime shivers (and who among us hasn't enjoyed watching horror movies with our friends, later professing that you weren't really that scared even though you know deep down that you're lying?), but rarely do the images stay with us after the sun comes up. No film, in fact, has triggered quite the same sensation of impending doom and crawling flesh that I received from a recent screening of The Blair Witch Project. This achievement is even more remarkable since the movie, a small production even by independent cinema standards, contains no name actors, no special effects, no script, only a handful of props, and a budget residing somewhere in the 'used car' price range. It's very rare indeed to find a film, any film, which offers not only a fresh, intriguing premise and superior performances, but also a complete retooling of the entire filmmaking process. There is no musical score here, nor smooth, clean editing (the story is presented as it was shot--with abrupt starts and starts courtesy of the amateur camera operators). But the movie's biggest surprise is the way that it doesn't feel like a movie at all: it's more akin to a historical record, like the infamous Zapruder Super 8 reel which captured John F. Kennedy's assassination for posterity. The movie is ficticious, of course, but you'd never know it. The performances are so incredibly astounding that the tale could easily pass for a real documentary (and in fact, it has fooled many viewers). Of particular note is the incredible Heather Donahue, the leader of the trio, who flawlessly conveys many complex emotions and, through her flawless performance, makes us feel them too. She gets the movie's standout scene, the one that will go down in movie lore ala the shower scene from Psycho: a mesmerizing monologue, delivered directly to the camera, in which she begs for forgiveness from her parents and the families of her two male companions. She believes that she is to blame for their current hopeless predicament, due to a judgment error made early in the journey. Heather seems to know, as do we, that time is running out for the group, and her plea for absolution is so hardhitting, the look in her eyes so tragic and terrified, that the viewer can easily be forgived for blinking back involuntary tears of his or her own. The film's skillful manipulation of the audience's fear is only accentuated by our knowledge that these precedings cannot possibly have a happy ending. In terms of pure originality, The Blair Witch Project is sheer genius. It is quite simply the most original approach to filmmaking I've seen in recent memory, as innovative and disarmingly unique today as Citizen Kane was upon its release nearly sixty years ago. It's proof that films don't have to cost a hundred million dollars to be fascinating. The movie is intense, scary, brilliant, and perhaps the best film of 1999 thusfar. But be warned: much of the story's terror comes not from watching the events of the story on the screen, but from witnessing them on mental instant-reply as the clock ticks away the long, early hours of the morning, when every sound in the darkness of your bedroom could be the Blair Witch, come to get you. I wasn't particularly scared while watching the movie. Then I tried to go to sleep an hour later.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D. Artisan Films Directors: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez Writers: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard, Bob Griffith, Jim King, Sandra Sanchez, Ed Swanson, Patricia Decou If you're going away this summer, you'll probably be sending the folks back home those picture post cards to make them jealous: ""Wish you were here,"" or some other original quip. Everybody has a great time on vacation. Never mind that the family's all together 24 hours a day under stressful conditions--foreign languages, strange customs, exhausting voyages and tours. Trekkers come home and what do they tell you? We had a great great time...fabulous! Do you believe them? Take the trio of twenty-somethings that drive to the arboreal acres of Maryland in Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick's fresh, imaginative feature. These kids have a purpose, and it isn't to ski, get a tan, play golf, swim, or some other bourgeois design. Like many their age, they considere themselves amateur filmmakers, loading up with both 16mm film and a High-8 video job intent on making a full-sized, prizewinning documentary to confirm or lay doubt on rumors of a witch in the woods. The three who journey on October 21, 1994 are Joshua Leonard, who shoots the 16mm film; Michael Williams, who captures the sound; and the group's leader, a Tracy-Flick-like Heather Donahue who took charge and kept the respect of the two males--for a while. Just one thing, though. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a documentary, not a docudrama, but a mockumentary, or mock documentary designed to give the audience the distinct impression that what they are watching really did happen. The group hike into the Black Forest region of Maryland, near the town of Burkittsville, to search out an old legend that the region was inhabited by the wicked Blair Witch--who allegedly tortured and killed trespassers from time to time since February 1785. Though an entire town is cursed by this outcast, Burkittsville is founded on the site of this witch, notwithstanding the fate of a 10-year old girl who is dragged to her death by a pale woman's hand--as seen by eleven witnesses. What made ""The Blair Witch Project"" captivating to some, so much that when its screening was announced at a recent Sundance Festival every one of a theater's 1300 seats filled up rapidly? Simply this: instead of giving the three trekkers a script to read, Myrick and Sanchez pulled a Marlon Brando and engaged them in ""method filmmaking."" The three young performers were given quick training in camera work and then turned loose for eight days to improvise according to their actual predilections. The directors planted actors in the town for the three to interview, turning the burg into a kind of Truman Show: the protagonists essentially are to pretend--kind of like Truman Burbank in Peter Weir's comedy--that they are not part of a movie at all. They speak with several salt-of-the-earth townspeople, most of whom insist that they do not believe the legend of the evil enchantress. In the one situation that could cause the audience to shudder, a small baby repeatedly puts her hand across her mother's mouth to prevent the adult from telling the scary story of the Blair Witch. The treatment given to the three (which resembles an effective fraternity hell week) recalls the training given to the cast of ""Saving Private Ryan."" The actors playing soldiers on the beach in the riveting opening moments of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece had gone through such rigorous discipline for the role that at least a half dozen repeatedly threatened to quit. In ""Blair,"" Donahue, Williams and Leonard are forced to suffer as actual people in their situation might have done. After a few days, they are soaked, exhausted and hungry to such an extent that they actually feel the terror of the journey, actually fearing for their lives. This adds markedly to the verisimilitude. As the three prepare for the trip by shopping, cracking jokes, and following Heather's background narration, they speak to residents of the town, drive to the woods, and proceed to hike for hours. Without a cell phone, they become increasingly anxious as they lose their bearings. When the map of the area--the only document that could virtually guarantee their safe arrival back to the car--disappears, panic takes over. As Heather, the confident tour leader, begins to lose it--screaming, crying, cursing--the three go increasingly off the wall, their disquiet reaching a climax when two of the party make a gruesome and bloody discovery. ""Blair,"" at once a road movie, a buddy drama, and a horror show, is the sort of film that could be expected to come from a studio like Artisan, known for willingness to experiment. Last year, Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi,"" released under the Artisan label, became the most innovative indie of the year. ""Pi"" featured the nerdish Max Cohen, a mathematical genius, who sets out to prove that everything can be reduced to a numerical pattern. Unfortunately, ""The Blair Witch Project"" does not come close to matching ""Pi."" Though we may indeed be convinced of the apprehension felt increasingly by the three performers, we feel strangely distanced from their dilemma. The fault lies paradoxically with improvisation which, for my money, almost never works. What's needed to get the pulse of the viewers racing is a solid script by a guy like David Mamet or, going back a while, to a director like James Whale. Only a tight screenplay effected by a director's strong hand, can accomplish the indisputable goal of every horror movie--to scare the living daylights out of everyone willing to suspend disbelief. Take, by contrast, the recent movie ""Limbo,"" which, like this one deals with people who are stranded in a remote area, so desperate for help that they are willing to risk their lives when an opportunity for rescue finally comes. ""Limbo"" is a near-great film--controversial ending and all--because of the superb skills of John Sayles at the helm. What we have here, though, is a group of kids who scream like banshees, uttering obscenities without a clever piece of dialogue in the 87-minute production. The moral? To convey an atmosphere of anarchy, a film may need an authoritarian hand at the controls--a tight script embodying a real story and firm direction. Though after viewing ""Blair"" some in the audience might vow never again to travel without a knowledgeable tour guide, I say, ""Bring on the woods...The city is hot and I have no problem tackling some sylvan splendor.""

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project (1999) Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard, Bob Griffith, Jim King, Sandra Sanchez, Ed Swanson, Patricia Decou. Screenplay by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. Directed by Sanchez and Myrick. 87 minutes. Rated R, 4 stars (out of five stars) Review by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly www.nuvo-online.com Archive reviews at http://us.imdb.com/M/reviews_by?Edward+Johnson-ott To receive reviews by e-mail at no charge, send subscription requests to pbbp24a@prodigy.com ""The Blair Witch Project"" opens with a title card that reads ""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found."" That's all you really need to know before viewing this ingenious, extremely creepy horror movie. Shot with two shaky hand- held cameras on a shoestring budget, ""The Blair Witch Project"" works because the creators remembered that the most effective of all special effects is the human imagination. With very little money (roughly $25,000) to work from, filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick decided to turn lemons into lemonade, constructing a storyline that would transform their financial and technical limitations into assets. The result is a ""mockumentary"" about the shooting of a documentary. Heather Donahue, a film student and aspiring director, sets off to explore the legend of the Blair Witch, an 18th century woman who supposedly haunts the Black Hills Forest of Maryland, periodically reaching out from the netherworld to strike at those who trespass on her domain. Heather is accompanied by two fellow students: cameraman and friend Joshua Leonard and sound operator Michael Williams. While Joshua shoots documentary footage on 16mm black and white film, Heather records virtually everything on video, for use in a ""The Making Of"" feature about their movie. After playfully filming each other and interviewing some locals, the trio heads off to search for the sight where the legend began, only to get lost in the woods. Hours grow into days, supplies grow scarce, tensions increase, and then the kids start hearing these strange noises... Setting the story in 1994 was smart. While firmly in our high-tech age, the year predates, just barely, the current climate where having a pocket cell phone is de rigueur for those under 30, so the idea of the three truly being cut-off from the outside world is plausible. Yet 1994 is recent enough to encompass the mentality of shows like ""The Real World,"" so Heather's insistence on keeping the cameras running even when the situation becomes extremely dire is not that much of a stretch. After all, the more dangerous things get, the more important it is to continue filming because, as the ""Real World"" mindset goes, we are all potential stars if, and only if, our lives provide enough high drama. The casting of Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard was equally inspired. All three actors (their actual names are used in the film, adding to the ""is this real?"" mystique) have a genuine quality crucial in making the production seem believable. Heather is determined, over-confident and a bit pushy; required traits for a director-in-the- making. When she tapes an introduction to the documentary, her delivery is self-conscious and a tad stilted, exactly what one would expect from a student filmmaker. Even though he is working with a friend, Joshua remains reticent, clearly more comfortable filming the action than being a part of it. As the outsider, Michael is the wild card of the group. The extremely likable young man does his best to cooperate with the others, despite his discomfort at being stuck in the middle of nowhere with two people he barely knows. I cared about the fates of these individuals and found myself hoping against hope that they would somehow avoid the fate predicted by the title card. ""The Blair Witch Project"" deftly creates a sense of dread that grows steadily as events progress, with the shaky camerawork, obscured views and limited night-lighting effectively amplifying the disorientating ambiance. To a degree, the actors actually experienced those feelings. They were left alone in a Maryland state park for extended periods of time, filming themselves and improvising their dialogue based on directoral notes left at prearranged drop points. The unnerving sounds they heard were provided by the directors, who would periodically sneak around the actors' campsites in the middle of the night. On Internet film newsgroups, where arguing and sniping is the norm, a debate rages between devotees of the movie and those who consider the production nothing more than an over-hyped gimmick. To be sure, there has been a great amount of hype for the film, but so what? Convincing a mass audience to try out a low-budget independent flick is a tough chore and the folks behind ""Blair Witch"" have used clever promotion to create a whale of an advance buzz. And the finished product delivers the goods. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is much more than a gimmick. Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have crafted a horror film that is genuinely disquieting, because they understand that no matter how much money studios throw into lurid nightmare imagery, the scariest monsters are those who lurk just out of sight, in the dark recesses of our own minds.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"There's a moment in ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I had to think of the Brady Bunch. Perhaps I'd been primed by the main characters singing the Gilligan's Island theme as they go off into the woods, but there's a moment evocative of Bobby picking up the tikki doll in the Hawaii episodes. Bad stuff is going to happen, though maybe not with anyone losing it on a surf board. Despite this, ""Blair Witch"" does generally go against the standard horror movie cliches. No deadly glitter of steel reflecting off a knife or axe, no false scares when the rattling in the woods turns out to be a bunny, no real shocks when the false scares turns into the lull before the storm. The movie's frights work through the ominous buildup of information, and suggestive noises in the night. Little gore is used, and what gore we do see is ambiguous. The creepiest Lovecraft stories I've read works similarly: much time is spent telling the dark history of this quiet house in, say, Providence, and only then do we venture inside. ""Blair Witch"", however, and despite the hype, really isn't the scariest movie ever made. Or at least I didn't find it that way. Maybe I couldn't suspend disbelief sufficiently -- I kept thinking that this was a problem that could have been solved with a GPS unit, a pair night vision goggles and some clue -- and, yes, there are creepy moments with the barely audible children's voices and the grove full of wood figures, and the quick vision in the cellar for some reason sticks in my mind, but I've seen scarier X-Files. Hell, the ""Return to the Cathedral"" and ""Bonehoard"" levels in the computer game ""Thief"" were creepier, at least until I figured out that my fire arrows work really well against the undead. Other people have used ""Blair Witches"" techniques of creepiness, and have done it better. I still think ""The Shining"" is the scariest movie I've seen. Give me the two dead girls and redrum any day. Besides background and creepy noises, the other major part of this movie is watching the lost hikers freak out as they slowly realize that they're lost and that there's something in the woods with them. I admire how well done this was. There's genuine fear in their faces at points. The film's publicity campaign stresses how much of this was ad libbed, with actors put out in the woods with relatively minimal instructions, and the directors and crew trying to scare the hell out of them in the middle of night. ""Method directing"". There's an interesting article in Salon about the film makers [1]. Basically, the author accuses the film makers of violating the relationship between them and their actors, fundamentally not trusting them to act. The purpose of this, apparently, was to make everything ""real"". The film makers decry standard film making for that art's ingenious fakery. Ironically, the signature scene in the film, when Heather is looking into the video camera and weepingly apologizes to everyone, must have been a scene that was relatively scripted, compared to the strategy of rousing up the actors, disorientating them and forcing them to run through the woods. It's also ironic, then, that the publicity surrounding this movie is constructed as it is. This campaign is all wonderful fakery, aimed at obliterating the line between reality and fiction. Partially to invoke the backstory, so necessary to the film's creepiness, in the lobby of the Angelika, where I saw the movie, are a number of nice vitrines illustrating the film's background, including a museum-like write up of the Blair Witch legend, the film canisters for the missing hikers' backpacks, and so on. We won't mention the websites (though this article does [2]) (Snopes has provided a short deconstruction of the ""facts"" of the piece [3].) They purposely blur the film's background into our hazy memory of childhood ghost stories: I had thought ""Blair Witch"" had something to do with the actual legend, centered on New Jersey or Pennsylvania or such (I was probably mixing the Bell Witch [4] with the Jersey Devil [5]). True, it's in the spirit of the ""mockumentary"", but I don't believe anyone else, not ""Spinal Tap"", not ""Dadetown"", has gone to such an extent. I'm reminded of the excellent book, ""Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonders"" [6], which describes Los Angeles's Museum of Jurassic Technology [7], a sort of piece of performance art dedicated to evoking the delicate, momentary weightlessness of wonder: wonder whether that exhibit is real, and wonder that it could possibly be real. ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't go much into wonder, however, and doesn't venture that far into fright.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"""The Blair Witch Project"" sees an innovative idea marred by poor execution. This low-budget film, now in wide release, uses a familiar documentary approach to bring a heightened realism to its subject matter. Since the movie is a good old-fashioned horror film (although splatter-free, the film retains an uncertain ""I Spit on Your Grave""-type quality), the producers felt that this technique would result in some genuine scares. Is it scary? Yes. But scary in that constantly looking outside the corners of the screen to avoid jumping out of your skin way, not the identifying with--and caring about the fates of--our leading players way. Here's the good idea that went a wastin'. In October of 1994, a trio of student filmmakers descended into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland in order to shoot a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch. They were never seen or heard from again. Their ""discovered footage"" serves as the basis for the film that is about to unfold, ""The Blair Witch Project."" Here's how its execution let it down. Heather, the documentary director (played by newcomer Heather Donahue), is a bit of a bossy boots with a dictatorial approach to the project that begins to irritate early on. She quickly starts annoying her fellow filmmakers, Josh (newcomer Joshua Leonard) and Mike (newcomer Michael C. Williams), and alienating her audience. Heather insists she knows where they are at all times but soon enough it becomes clear they are lost. In addition, Heather is obsessively true to her medium, and refuses to turn off their color video camera, their b/w 16mm camera, or their digital tape recorder. So that when things start to get scary--read on--Heather's right there with one of the cameras stuck in a crew member's face, often while she's screaming ""What the heck is that!?"" or more colorful words to that effect. If the circumstances in which our protagonists find themselves are as horrifying as suggested then it defies all rational and logical behavior for Heather to keep her camera rolling, no matter how dedicated an auteur she may be. Donahue, Leonard, and Williams are clearly all amateurs and when the going gets tough, their collective acting talents disintegrate. The supporting characters who play the Burkittsville (formerly Blair) yokels, and provide interview-styled accounts of what they know about the Blair Witch, are also unconvincing. For a film like this to work, they need to be absolutely believable as real people. After a while, the film becomes frustrating in its repetitiveness. During the day, the threesome constantly bitch and moan about how lost they are, whose fault it is, and what happened to the damned map. They head due south for a day and wind up in the same spot as when they started, all the time following their compass. At night, they hear strange noises all around them and go rushing out of their tent screaming ""Oh my God!"" lit only by a dim camera bulb, the black-and-white trees positively encroaching on their frightened persons. In the morning, there are little piles of stones or twigs surrounding their camp. If you're afraid of little piles of stones or twigs then I guess this is one heck of a scary movie! This cycle then repeats itself over and over again. Whine whine, scream scream, stones twigs. ""The Blair Witch Project"" relies heavily on the power of implied horror, meaning it's something of an anomaly in today's day and age, yet as a result it's the kind of movie you can really only see once to appreciate (or not). Whereas I can truly understand what filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were trying to achieve with this film, they made too many mistakes along the way. Got beef?

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"May contain objectional material and spoilers. Starring: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard. The movie opens with this message: ""In October of 1994, three student filmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary....a year later their footage was found."" ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a brilliant, inventive, original and downright horrifying movie that isn't your typical scare people by jumping type. This movie has only shot of blood, no violence, no ghosts, no witches or anything. What the movie does, is make your imagination run wild, and makes you scared by what you don't see. The movie has no scary music and no jump scenes. The scares are strong and long-lasting, and when something is happening it doesn't go to another scene, it stays on that scene till it's over. The movie is in a style of a documentary. Three film-makers: Heather Donahue, Joshua Williams, and Michael Leonard. The three travel to Burkittsville, Maryland to film a documentary based on the myth of the Blair Witch. Everyone in this town knows about it, or her. Everyone knows that in the 40's a man brutally killed children based on he heard voices in his head, which was the Blair Witch. The three excited and hyped up go to camp out in the woods. They hike the trails everyday, and enjoy the fresh air. When they get back to their tent, and begin to get in for the night, they hear noises, twigs cracking. Then they find strange artifacts hanging from trees. They hear voices, screams, laughs, as their food begins to dwindle they are forced to live under strict conditions. All three of them are scared, not able to understand what is going on. Their way out is blocked, they find rocks and other sort of strange things. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror movie. But not the type of 'Scream' movies you expect. This movie is downright scary and original. It is filmed in the way of a documentary with thier footage and docu footage combined. It doesn't have any ghosts or witches or anything to jump out at you to scare you. This film is genuinely scary. And I have to say not to offend anyone, but if you don't or didn't like this then you didn't understand it. If you thought it was boring, then you didn't listen. If you thought the ending was bad, then well nevermind. To put it another way: 'The Blair Witch Project' is an instant classic. The opening message is what we are watching. The footage that was found. But what we have to tell ourselves while watching this movie is that it is only a movie. Nothing more, there are actors, actresses, directors and more. While watching this movie, well no scratch that you don't 'watch' this movie, you expierence this movie. You are made a character and brought into the woods along with the students. This movie is the scariest...no the most horrifying and terrifying movie ever made. After it is over, you are left there thinking, and after it you are still thinking. What was that? Who is that? I wonder what did that...These are the many questions left unanswered. I don't think you will be able to sleep much after this movie. I don't think you will be able to even think much after this movie. At least that's from my expierience. See 'The Blair Witch Project' to learn what it is like to be horrified. Then see it again.....

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"""On October 21, 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams hiked into the Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary film on a local legend called 'The Blair Witch,' and were never seen again. One year later, their footage was found."" These are the opening lines of The Blair Witch Project. There are no credits, there is no flashback sequence, and there is no friendly narrator to guide you through this. The next 87 minutes is the three filmmakers' footage in chronological order - or so the audience is made to believe. In reality those 87 minutes are occupied with unique filmmaking and a beautiful script which amalgamates for one of the scariest and most intense films since Alfred Hitchcock gave us a reason to not shower in 1960. But the film is not without its flaws either. A simple reality check can lead to some questionable aspects. And the production doesn't have the ability that Hitchcock had to make the film stick with you. The urban legend that is the Blair Witch is like most urban legends, in that it is confusing and unclear. Different people have different stories, and almost nothing is documented. The little that is known tells us that the Blair Witch has taken victims in the past, and is favorable to torturous, dismembering techniques. One person describes the creature as ""an old woman, who's feet never touch the ground."" Another description says ""she was hairy from head to toe."" That is, if there is a Blair Witch in the first place, something a respectably sized faction questions. The unknowingly doomed group heads off into the Maryland woods after doing some brief interview work in Burkittsville, Maryland, where the town of Blair used to stand. The group of three gradually see their documentary evolve into a creepy and frustrating experience that tears at the very fabric of their relationships in a very similar manner to which MTV presents their popular show ""The Real World."" At the core of the tumultuous relationship is Heather's authoritarian directing work. She demands nearly every moment be caught on film, including the behind-the-scenes aspects which she insists the group will someday look back on laugh. The footage is intentionally shaky, co-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanches' attempt to give the film the ultimate realistic feel. But after a while you are led to question why the footage taken for the film would be of such a poor nature if Heather really is the great perfectionist that she is made out to be. You also can't help but notice than not more than once is any mention of reloading film made; despite the movie's claim of 21 roles being discovered. In The Blair Witch Project, there are no ghosts, no goblins, no monsters, there isn't even a witch shown on screen. There is no background music to gradually lead the audience into fear. There is only one isolated incident of blood and gore, a very mild one at that. Instead of using these traditional aspects to bring the crowd into horror and fear, the production simply plays with your nerves. By telling you the fate of the three protagonists before the film opens, a permanent dramatic irony is created. However, this aspect also brings a major downside as well. About one hour into the film, things have already gotten creepy and the group is already at odds with each other. This creates a sort of ""Just die already!"" sense, that makes the meager 87 minutes seem perhaps a few too many. The Blair Witch Project is definitely a clever film. Although Artisan Entertainment declined my request for a budget figure, it can be assumed that the movie was made at a fraction of what most independent films cost, and couldn't even be fairly measured against the budget of Hollywood blockbusters. During the movie I was scared, but towards the end a feeling came over me where I just wanted the darn thing to end. And when it did, there was a queasy feeling in my stomach, but I think it came from eating too much popcorn.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"All the hype and its resultant backlash have destroyed the conditions for the kind of pleasant surprise that caused initial reviewers to rave about this film, but the idea is clever (the film is supposedly found footage taken by a missing film crew that was investigating the legend of the Blair Witch) and the execution is reasonably good. I felt the atmosphere would have benefited from an inclusion of the town's history, which I hear is what the ""The Mythology of the Blair Witch"" program on the SCI-FI Channel is about, but simply showing a chronology at the beginning of the film (which you can see on-line at http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html ) would have intensified the mood. (You can simulate the effect by printing out the chronology and reading it while waiting in line or sitting inside the theatre so it's fresh in your mind when the film begins.) I found the first half of the film better than I expected and my interest was sustained by the touches of humor, mundane details of the trip and the banter between the three principals. In the second half, since the story was limited by the movie's structure and the filmmaker's budget, it was obvious there was only so much that could happen and I started to get a little bored, a little claustrophobic (they're going around in circles in the same featureless patch of woods) and annoyed by the characters' constant bickering. The final shot (or second to final shot, if you will) *was* rather chilling and while the film didn't actually scare me, my nerves were a little tense when I left the theatre. The film may play back better in your head than it does on the screen as your imagination edits out the weak parts and intensifies the creepy ones. A nice effort for a small film and Worth Seeing. (Just don't expect to see ""the scariest film ever made."") [Note 1: If you're trying to see the film at the Bridge in San Francisco, get your tickets days in advance. I had no problem getting tickets to the Thursday 5:30 show an hour in advance, but the 7:40 and 9:50 shows were already sold out for both that night *and* the next night . Later that night I happened to pass the theatre and there was a huge line for the midnight show -- on a weeknight! As with any popular movie in San Francisco, even after you have tickets, get there an hour in advance in order to get a good seat.) [Note 2: If you sit too close to the screen, as I was tipped off by a friend, the hand-held nature of the photography may make you dizzy and nauseous. I was quite a ways back and still had to close my eyes frequently -- for reasons other than fright!] The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Mockumentaries are in. Earlier this year Myles Berkowitz showed us himself as he attempted to find love and happiness on his 20 DATES. Few people saw that movie, perhaps because most people can't get worked up over some guy whose problem is that he's so obnoxious that women don't want to go out with him more than once. A fake documentary about getting killed in the woods by a witch is another matter entirely. One of the biggest art house hits in years, the movie has now crossed over to the commercial theaters as well due to the unprecedented level of interest. Made by joint writer and director Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez on a sum so small that it would be less that the rounding error on most Hollywood films, the movie's financial success is without question. But how about the movie? Having been on vacation during THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's release and hoopla, I saw the film much later than normal. The idea for the story is undeniably clever. Three young adults go into the woods to film a documentary on the Blair Witch. They never return. The movie consists of the film and videotape found one year after their disappearance. Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard are the young filmmakers who perish. Whoops, I mean these three actors play filmmakers with the same names. If you're the sort who believes that Elvis is still alive, you can check out THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT web site, where more ""truths"" about the project are revealed. This is all quite cute. Cute, however, can only go so far. As the three of them wander aimlessly in the woods going in circles while their compass points due south, their yelling at each other can get quite tedious. Nonetheless, it is easy to admire the filmmakers' audacity. They have certainly tried to craft something unusual. Unusual, yes. Interesting, no. If you suffer from motion sickness, the camera work will have you looking for the barf bag. They leave the cameras going so you see pans across everything from the ground to the trees. Imagine your 6-year-old making a home movie, and you'll get some idea of what to expect. Some theater owners are even training their employees on how to deal with vomiting. ""It's very hard to get lost in America these days,"" one of the characters remarks after several days of wandering through the forest with strange sounds and rock formations behind every tree. ""And even harder to stay lost. We have that on our side."" When the ending credits roll, instead of gasping for breath or thinking about how scared you were, you may find yourself asking instead, ""That's it? That's all there is?"" Scary? Not for a second. Even so, the next project by these two directors is something to look forward to. At least they are willing to take risks. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT runs 1:22. It is rated R for language and would be fine for teenagers.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The premise is pretty simple. Three young film students go out into the woods of Maryland to get footage for a project on what locals call the Blair Witch, an entity who supposedly comes to claim lives from the local population every so many years. Although their foray is supposed to last only a couple of days, they get lost and have a difficult time getting their bearings despite their possession of a map and a compass. Worse yet, each night they are tormented by strange, haunting noises, and each morning find evidence that someone or something knows they are there. Is it the Blair Witch? Whatever it is, the students never come out of the forest again. Sounds like a fairly run-of-the-mill horror movie, but what's different about this film is it's a documentary. Well, okay, it's a mockumentary, but the style in which THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is filmed is so natural, it takes on a very eerie reality. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez hired three actors, gave them sketchy details about the roles they were to play and the rough outline of the plot, and turned them loose in the woods with cameras, food, and a global positioning system receiver so they would at least know where they were at any given time. Myrick, Sanchez, and a small crew followed the actors at a distance and left them food and new camera batteries at predetermined checkpoints. The actors were free to improvise dialog, and shot all the footage themselves with a small videocamera and a 16mm black and white, giving the whole thing a documentary-like look and feel. The improvised script is also very effective, for even though much of the dialog is repetitive and simplistic, it's probably more akin to what real people would say in this situation than anything pre-written could have achieved. It's as if what these three actors are experiencing is very, very real, making the film even scarier than you'd think. Aiding in the illusion of reality has been a campaign of rumors and publicity implying that the story of the disappearing film students were true. Even though the directors and actors have been subsequently interviewed for printed articles, many unknowing viewers have been uncertain as to the origin of the footage, purported to have been found mysteriously in the basement of an abandoned house a year after the ""students"" disappearance. Believe me, creepy as this film was, the fright factor would have gone up exponentially if I had been under the impression it were real. If you've got friends who don't know the secret, don't spoil it for them yet. Except for a few rare instances, the film doesn't explicitly show us anything that would actually scare us. Instead, most of the scares come from the reactions of the actors, leaving the sources of their terror to your imagination. Moreover, a few of the occurrences are even left up to your own interpretation, causing mild chills for the next several days as you run the possibilities through your mind. Those looking for definitive answers, or those who are more fond of today's ""show everything"" style of horror film may find this film lacking, but others will find this approach a breath of fresh air. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is not one of those barn burners that throws scares at you the moment the film starts to roll. Instead, it's a slow pot boiler that gives you circumstances and information that ultimately lead up to an incredibly scary last 20 minutes. So frightening is this portion, that ""It's not real"" was a mantra I said to myself every so often. However, that's not to say that the film is badly paced with nothing to offer until the end. On the contrary, while the first hour of the film may not be exactly frightening, it is a very interesting character study as the film students realize their hopelessly lost situation, then become aware that they may not be alone in the forest, and ultimately lose their presences of mind. As they slip down that slope toward their ultimate fate, we're right there along with them. However, as effective as this film is, there are at least two things which stand in the way of making it more enjoyable. First is the fact that the cameras keep rolling through virtually everything. The students have an argument and it's caught on tape. The students are scared out of their wits at something they can't see, and yet manage to keep the 16mm going the whole time. It occurs to you more than once that any regular person would drop the camera once things started getting desperate, and therefore the illusion of reality is shattered in a few places. But to their credit, the actors provide a semi-decent explanation (looking through the camera filters reality, and they sure don't want to be there), and besides, without the constant filming there would be no movie. The second problem is the constant jarring motion of both cameras, especially the video camcorder. I realize it would be pretty difficult to keep a hand-held camera steady while on the move, but the shakiness was to the extreme and left many at my screening with a headache or nausea. Be warned that if you're susceptible to motion sickness, this film may not be for you. If you see THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, just keep in mind that the payoff doesn't occur until the end. I've heard reports of people walking out prematurely because ""nothing happened,"" but to do so would be a definite mistake. If you wish to be scared, be patient and you will be rewarded. But as they say, be careful what you wish for. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Written, Directed, and Edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Starring Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000) The Blair Witch Project can be described with many adjectives, one of which is mildly nauseating. Watching the camera shake and shimmy and other adjectives beginning with ""s"" used by William Shatner during Airplane 2, one cannot help but either get a stomach ache or a headache and wonder why they left the Alks Seltzer at home. Myself, I spent half of the movie thinking of the old jingle: ""pop, pop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is."" To describe The Blair Witch Project's plot is simple: three student filmmakers decide to make a documentary and end up disappearing in the woods of Burkitsville, Maryland. They spend time arguing and slowly disintegrating into madness, at the same time being haunted by the Blair witch. The key word here is slowly. Although this, by technical definitions, is an excellent horror movie, it remains as genre as anything else turned out. The film takes its time getting to the scares, but does not make tension in the meantime. Before I go on my analytical and essayistic diatribe, you should probably know that The Blair Witch Project is a complete hoax. It is a hoax done so well that one cannot help but be scared by it (I'll give The Blair Witch Project that, it actually scared me at a few moments). The film, however a well done of a hoax it is, feels boring. It also feels real. Supernatural elements aside, the dialogue, the camerawork, the emotions, and even the timing: all of these things feel incredibly real to the viewer. People do not suddenly go insane in real life: it is a slow process. Nor does terror become complete immediately. The Blair Witch Project, taking its time, is true to life as it displays the emotions and nature of what people in that situation would be and feel like. This most likely comes from the way that the movie was filmed, from the complete ad-libbing that makes up the script, and from the fact that the actors and actresses had very little idea what was going on. However, as the film becomes more ""realistic"", it also becomes more boring. As much as we would not like to admit it, the thing that attracts us to film is the escapism from it. Even in ultra-realistic films such as Taxi Driver, we still feel that bizarre contrast between being complete in the reality that the movie creates while being separate from it. Our view of realism, of Hollywood realism, is that of a good orchestral score, background music, good cinematography, and all of the other technical aspects of filmmaking that we take for granted. The emotions and reactions of the people may be completely realistic, but, on some level, we want the fake. We want the unreal -- and better -- camera angles, lighting, musical accompaniment and contrived lines that go along with films. The Blair Witch Project gets my very lukewarm acceptance as a horror film, if only because it hits its teen target head on. The teen crowds can go with their girlfriends or boyfriends and make out (thus saving the need for motion sickness pills), and they can, if they so wish, be cynical and crack on the movie. The Blair Witch Project is open for insult in this fashion. As far as viewing The Blair Witch Project as a social commentary, I am giving it a resounding recommendation. The Blair Witch Project, in the most backhanded way, teaches us that what we truly are searching for in the movies is not realism, but instead the illusion of it. Much as art is the illusion of sentience, The Blair Witch Project illustrates the need for the illusion of reality created by the movies. It illustrates, in a way very difficult to achieve, the need for the contrived in our lives to make them interesting. Concluding, The Blair Witch Project is oddly haunting, especially in the aspect that it provides a mirror to our own desires. That it contains, without script, without musical score, without any of the bonuses we take for granted, a blistering satire of our own desires to experience not the real, but the illusion.MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of the New Millenium To subscribe, email MK2K-subscribe@listbot.com To request a review, email MK2K@usa.net The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"There is a paradox in filmmaking. The viewer goes to a film to see an experience, but ironically not really to share the experience. We as viewers want to see the story, but we do not really want to participate in the experience. The filmmakers we consider to be the best do not make realistic films. These great stylists of cinema are mostly people that rather than making a film real for us make it unreal. The most real film is crude footage right out of a hand-held camera. Even using Steadicam is stepping away from reality. As we look at he world our head bobs and jerks. Steadicam smoothes out the bobs and jerks making the resulting film less real. A rare few films use crudity and a lack of style to make the film more real for the viewer. THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is an effective horror film, not because a great stylist polished it but because it looks like it is not polished at all. It is shot in black and white and photographed crudely. It does have music, but it is the music that the filmmakers could get free and the music is rough. Color and a lush orchestral score are a distraction. As I write this review there are two horror film in wide release. The remake of THE HAUNTING is a highly glossy film with great special effects and images from the imagination of an artist. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT on the other hand is shot primitively with hand-held cameras and has almost no music. And that lack of style makes the film seem all the more real. By showing almost nothing of the menace in the story it allows the viewer's mind complete freedom to imagine the threat. In fact THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT--perhaps coincidentally--very nearly follows the rules of Dogma 95. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was made on a very tiny film budget, and it is made with almost no stylistic tricks. In fact it has no style whatsoever to distance the viewer from the action. That makes it the most effective horror film we have seen in years. The plot of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is obvious from the first minutes of the film. We are told at the very beginning of the film that in October 1994 three student filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard (played by Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard) were making a film. They went into the Maryland woods near Burkittesville to shoot a documentary about a local legend, the Blair Witch. They never came out of that woods and we are told a year later their film footage was found. We don't even know how it is supposed to have been unearthed. But we are seeing the raw film footage they shot. It is clear from the beginning that they were incompetents and should not be out in the wild by themselves. It is not hard to guess what trouble they found in the woods and what caused them not to come back. The film spends the rest of its short 85-minute length showing the viewer what was expected to happen did happen. This is not a great plot. It is almost no plot at all, in fact. The viewer knows what is going to ensue and just sits there to see it happen and to pick up the details. Yet just seeing it all happen without having the filmmaker interpose style between the viewer and the story makes this film an experience so immediate and intense that people are walking out of the film rather than subjecting their nerves to the film. The special effects in this film are all mostly sound effects. They are all easy to create, but they tap into a basic fear of being vulnerable in the woods, in the night, in the dark (to paraphrase both versions of THE HAUNTING). This is a film that will tap into some very basic fears. The film is written, directed, and edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. It is a Haxen Films production (probably named for the classic 1922 Norwegian film documentary HAXEN, meaning ""Witches""). The three main characters apparently play themselves. According to the publicity most of the dialog is improvised, giving it a real immediacy. Apparently they were given a rough plot outline and identifying with the characters they argued among themselves in a sort of role-playing game. I would bet that the scenes were filmed in very much the order that we see them in the film to make easier the slow build in the actors' hysteria. The reported cost of shooting the film was $20,000, but the film is playing to full houses. It is the kind of trick that probably can be done effectively only once, though THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is bound to have imitators. This is a film of incredible intensity. It has no sex, no violence, a fair amount of medium-strong language, but less than a lot of other films in theaters. Yet it is too strong for even some of the adults seeing the film. I rate it an8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale. In case there is any confusion the film THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the television documentary ""The Curse of the Blair Witch,"" and any legends or historical factoids found in either are complete fictions created for the film. A possible exception is the television description of the backgrounds of the three film students who were real people and played themselves in the film. There never was a Blair Witch or an attempt to do a serious documentary about her. Dogma 95 is a European film movement founded by Danish filmmaker Lars von Triers. It is intended to bring film back to a more natural sort of filmmaking. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT follows, as far as I can tell, the first seven of the rules and breaks the last three. However, its compliance with so many of the rules of Dogma 95 may be purely coincidental. The following are the rule of Dogma 95. I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and confirmed by DOGMA 95: 1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found). 2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot). 3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place where the camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film takes place). 4. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera). 6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.) 7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now.)

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"http://www.speakers-podium.com/susangranger. Susan Granger's review of ""THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"" (Artisan Entertainment) On October 21, 1994, three young film-makers hiked into the Black Hills Forest of Maryland to shoot a documentary about the local legend of the Blair Witch. They were never seen or heard from again. One year later, their footage was found. This film is their legacy, we're told, documenting what happened in the woods. Heather Donahue sets the stage by interviewing residents about the spooky folktale that involves mysterious disappearances and evidence of gruesome torture. Her two male companions, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, trudge along. Terror strikes on the second night when they hear snapping twigs and branches that sound like people circling their tent - and then they find a hank of hair ritualistically tied with blood and human tooth. ""I'm scared to close my eyes. I'm scared to open them,"" she says, as the fear builds. While the twisted conclusion is not as horrific as you might expect, it's ambiguous enough to keep you talking after the show's over. The story behind this low-budget, counterfeit chiller is: writer-director-editors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez hired three actors and sent them into the woods for eight days to improvise the picture. Certain destination points and encounters were scripted, others definitely weren't. Therefore, the images you see on the screen are often crude and jiggly - due to the hand-held camera. Nevertheless, on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a goose-bumply, spine-tingling, scary 7. This creepy, clever, edge-of-your-seat thriller succeeds because it plays on your imagination, your fear of the dark and the unknown and the unseen, as opposed to showing graphic displays of violence and brutality. What you create in your mind is far more terrifying than anything someone can do with special effects.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"This is more of a response than a review, but I think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great film - just not necessarily a great horror film. I admire it most for its creativity. Filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick ran with the idea of shoving three young actors out in the Maryland woods. They must operate their own cameras and improvise all of the dialogue. Of course there is always the fall-back of editing. But the sheer originality is refreshing to watch. I guess we have to overlook that the camera seems to be running much of the time, and not only when the supposed cameramen are filming actual parts of the documentary. We see Heather (Heather Donohue) introducing the legend, the camera showing the faded stones of a graveyard. But we also watch the trio leave Josh's (Josh Leonard) car on the side of the road, Heather working the camera as the men behind her trudge into the woods in search of the locales involved in the legend. Although we never witness mundane things like meals, we do see several breaks the characters take as they hike under the trees. And the choppiness of sudden cuts to the darkness of night is excusable. I'm sure the best thing about the set, to the filmmakers, is that it was free. The remote forest is pristine, primeval, and most of all, ominous. I thought of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories, so-called civilized man venturing into the darkness, possibly to meet his doom. At times we watch shots of the forest's extreme beauty; then darkness descends and the story tightens down to small enclosures of nylon pup tents. These are familiar scenes to viewers who have camped. What makes the characters take notice is the unfamiliar noises during the blackest part of night. Rocks knock together, branches rustle, and human voices cry hoarsely and once even laugh. Why do I say ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great film? Mostly for the chances it takes to be different. The premise is a cool idea, and you can't help liking these indedpendent filmmakers and their gutsy young actors. My bottom line is that the piece succeeds as a psychological study as much as any other genre. I've read snippets of hype like the movie ""does for the woods what 'Jaws' did for the water,"" and yes, there is a lot of suspense worked into the package. But 'Jaws' is a suspense film, not properly horror. At its heart, ""Blair Witch"" follows the fascinating degeneration of psyches: as they become lost, assault each other in anger, and run in terror through the lightless woods, these jaded young adults let us glimpse the core of their humanity, and we are moved. But maybe people don't want to be moved by the plights of characters; maybe they view these figures only as victims - fodder for a monster that they eventually hope to see, and that they hope is gruesome and more terrible than any special effects they have previously gawked at. There's the rub. Hey, typical American viewer! Don't you realize yet that the most terrifying agent in this type of movie is your own imagination? If you want to see slashing and blood-black gore, get thee hence! Rent an 80's flick from one of the franchises. Because what we have here is the chance of a revival of suspense films that actually make you think and make connections. Wow! There is not insulting of the intelligence at the beginning - only a quick set-up (perhaps too quick) for characterization. But so many elements come across freshly because of their improvised nature. Why did Spielberg put most of the ""Saving Private Ryan"" cast through boot camp-like training? What comes across on camera is more genuine, of course. Place three actors out in the woods for several days - and the length of their ordeal does become a wee bit tiresome - and you are bound to come up with an edge that can't be faked by the best actors. When Heather glances at her mud-caked hands and fingernails, we see the conditions that are crossing the lines of human endurance. How else could Heather seem so genuine in her self-filmed apology to the mothers of her crew? This scene is very unflattering to Heather physically. We see up inside her quivering nostrils, her dirty hair is hidden inside her ski cap, her red-rimmed eyes leak tears that collect on the tip of her nose. Just a magnificent and naturalistic performance. I've mentioned a few flaws along the way. Another is that I wanted to call out, ""What are you standing around fighting for? Why don't you double-time it down any trail? You can cover forty miles in a day if you're desperate!"" Yet I suppose a certain hopelessness grips them, and when they happen across the same log they crossed much earlier the same day, we get a sense that perhaps they are not just wandering foolishly in widening circles, but they are victims of some especially tortuous haunting. Anyhoo, wouldn't at least one of the characters start praying or invoking God in this situation? Josh wears a talisman around his neck - the horn that wards off evil. It's funny, but just as their humanity makes us wish for their safety, other aspects of their behavior make us not care so much for them. Next, the hype. I've been fascinated by the advertising of films since I begged my mother endlessly for a buck so I could buy a ""The Sound of Music"" coloring book! What strikes me here is that I knew more about the mythology of the Blair witch than was actually contained in the picture! Because I read the official web site's version, I knew the origin of the folklore - the pre-Colonial woman being exiled into the woods, the disappearance of children and the bundles of twigs clogging the lake. But these items constitute a dishonest type of reverse engineering. It's virtually impossible to look at the film by itself, as a result of the additional fictions woven about it. At the center of this grisly bundle is a decent - though very consciously rough - little story. It's a stroke of both genius and exploitation to surround the movie with all the other stuff, when it could have been included in a few more minutes of footage. On the site you see photos of state cops and searches and read the stories of the agonized parents and the eventual release of the footage found abandoned. Very slick indeed. But it's not part of the 86-minute movie. It's just as cheesy as the hype surrounding any type of artist with a bloated personality cult. Fortunately this film, divorced from the hype, is still decent. I don't see the end of this multi-faceted advertising, but only much more of it, especially on the Internet. Oh, I realize the dialogue is improvised, and we never see a good deal of the film the actors shot. But c'mon, do they really need to use the f-word so many times? It becomes like any syllable repeated until meaningless. The characters' languages - body language and paralanguage - put across more terror than their cursing. (At the very least, copiers of ""Blair Witch"" should attempt more colorful variations on the standard four-letter expletives!) Because it's become an important part of our lore and current culture, you should see ""The Blair Witch Project."" You've heard the thing was made for around $30,000, sold to Artisan Entertainment for a cool million, and has grossed many more millions in its first weeks of release. If that doesn't impress, then the bare-bones creativity will. (And if you think hard enough, you begin to wonder what is really stalking the trio - something beyond nature or something cultish.) The viewing experience is more creepy than scary. But there are also a few nicely-wrought comic bits, as when Mike (Mike Williams) corrects the others when they call 'The Skipper' from ""Gilligan's Island"" by the name of 'Captain.' In all, the film is gritty and realistic - cinema verite to the nth degree -- and finally, enjoyably unsettling. Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE (director: Daniel Myrick; screenwriters: Daniel Myrick/Eduardo Sanchez; cinematographer: Neal Fredericks; cast: Heather Donahue (Heather the director ), Michael Williams (Mike the sound guy), Joshua Leonard (Josh the cameraman), 1999) There is something to be said about simplicity: it is unencumbering. To shoot a film about a weekend excursion, shot in 16mm and on a high-8 video hand-held camcorder and have it shown in theaters, as the picture jumps back and forth during the entire film, making it really annoying to view, and have the audience be understanding about this, means that this film, shot as if it were a true documentary, has captured something genuine on screen that an audience is craving for. It also should move it into cult film status for these 5 Central Florida University film school students (3 actors,writer and director), who should be proud of their achievement, accomplished by having a sound idea and made without hardly any money for its production; the only other thing needed by them was the conviction to do their own thing and in their own way. Heather Donahue (Heather the director ), Michael Williams (Mike the sound guy), Joshua Leonard (Josh the cameraman), play the three young people on camera who hike through Maryland's dark woods in search of finding out more about the legend of the Blair Witch (Elly Kedward, found guilty of sorcery in 1785 and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter). The film begins by announcing the disappearance in the woods of ""Burkittsville Maryland"" of these three documentary filmmakers in 1994, and the film presents itself as what the camera shows was left behind after their disappearance. As we watch the footage from the evidence recovered, we know as much about the legend as the youngsters knew when they went out on their trek. The horrors come about when we see how their expressions change from one of horseplay and showing off their purchases of junk food and the good feelings they have to one another, to one of real fear and anger with each other. It is the horror on their faces and the way their expressions show real apprehension that give this film a different twist to it than the usual horror story, which, too often, relies on special effects. It matters not what is seen along the way or how well they are acting, professional actors could not have done a better job. What is really scary to see, is how panic stricken they are when they realize they are really lost in the woods, that they have little chance of getting out on their own and are in need of a rescue party to find them. This makes the last minute of the film the most haunting part of it. It sticks with you well after viewing it, as you wonder what could have happened to them. It reminded me somewhat of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", that film also effectively left the disappearance up to the imagination and did not dwell on the details of the children's demise. This method of filming mysterious disappearances, proves to be an interesting way of handling it, especially when you don't have much in your budget and your story is razor thin. The flaws in this project are that it was like going on the trek yourself, walking over bumpy logs, getting wet, and feeling cold and uncomfortable, and listening to all those snidish remarks and whining that came out of the three. I would not like to see other films made this way, or see a follow-up to this film, a film that lucked out and became an enormous commercial success, which should make ""big time"" movie producers drool with envy. This film, just happened to capture the spirit of the project and was done in a satisfying way so as to reassure us that we were seeing something that appeared to be genuinely creepy. Follow-up films rarely capture the same spirit, and by correcting the jumpy camera would not, necessarily, enhance the film. This film did what it had to do and should be savored as the popular cult film it is or will certainly become. It made a virtue out of shooting a low-budget and unsophisticated story in the raw. The other thing the film didn't do, was give us enough information about the legend. I would have felt more toward the effort, if I had more of a story and some more pertinent dialogue to go along with the scariness of the film. It was also hard on the ears to hear their conversations, both because of the poor sound quality and their endless ramblings, punctuated only by profanity. But this is overwritten by their excellent use of the forest itself, its twigs (designed to give the film its terrifying logo) and rocks and darkness, as in one sense the area was found to be beautiful, but when things went wrong, an ugliness of mood and environment set in, giving the film all the props they would need to make this horror film scary. I would give it an A if it was shown to a film school class and held up as an example of how to make an innovative film on practically nothing. But as a professional offering, I would be more critical, and my overall discomfort in watching the film would have me lower the grade significantly. Though I do heartily recommend this film for the more adventurous sorts, and feel it is difficult to evaluate because of the thinness of the story and such, yet it has an appeal to it that goes beyond what we ordinarily look for in a film. That something special is what draws us to this film, but not to a point where we remain uncritical of it. The film leaves the elements of mystery about it, as its ending is very much connected to its beginning interview scenes of the locals, which should provide many provocative responses from the enthusiasts of this film, who will add mystery onto the mystery for this most dizzying and engaging film... Incidentally, I did feel like I was motion-sick when I left the theater. I wonder how many others felt that way!

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is the most profitable movie in American history. Made at a cost of $30,000, it returned $48 million in its first week of wide release. Its huge box-office success, threadbare production values and offbeat approach to the horror genre have generated widespread discussion. What does ""The Blair Witch Project"" mean for movie-making in general? Furthermore, what does its dark theme tell us about the mood of the American society, particularly among the youth who have catapulted it into success? Before discussing these questions, it would be worthwhile to consider the film as film. Made by two neophyte directors, 35 year old Daniel Myrick and 30 year old Eduardo Sanchez, it depicts in self-referential fashion--but importantly, absent any sense of irony--the making of a student documentary in the woods of Maryland where according to legend a homicidal witch dwells. The student director Heather (Heather Donohue) is accompanied only by Michael the cameraman (Michael Williams) and soundman Joshua (Joshua Leonard). With packs on their back, they descend into the forest on Halloween looking for interesting footage to use in their film, most particularly a cemetery where victims of the witch are buried--mostly children. Heather is a compulsive film-maker and takes shots continuously, including bags of marshmallows in a supermarket where they have stocked up for the hike, and of a dead mouse on the side of the trail. The two young men occasionally get annoyed at her, but she insists that she is serious about her documentary and wants to get in as much footage as possible. She is in control not only of the film--perhaps overly so, but of their safety as well. She has a map that they keep referring to as they make their way deeper and deeper into the gloomy autumn woods. Not too long after they have entered the depths of the forest, they begin to notice spooky piles of stones on the ground and stick figures hung from the branches of trees. At night in their tent they hear indistinct cries outside in the distance. Although nobody ever sees their source, they are continuously on their minds. Heather takes it all in stride since all of these elements will only help to make her film more interesting. The mood of the film changes drastically when it is discovered that Josh the soundman has thrown the map into a brook as a gesture of defiance against the overbearing Heather. At first the three head due south in hopes of running into a settled area, but after a sixteen hour hike they end up exactly where they started out from. At night, after pitching their tent, they again hear the eerie cries from within the forest, which seem closer now. The three young film-makers eventually succumb to the dark forces of the forest and the film purports to be based on their footage, which survived them. An elaborate website (www.blairwitch.com) has been created to fill in details that were left out of the theatrical release. But in keeping with the mock documentary spirit of the film, the website assumes that the events depicted in the film actually took place. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is really not a movie about ghosts, witches and monsters. It is about insecurity and it is very good at capturing the genuinely creepy fears that everybody has about being lost in the woods. It is a noir version of the scene in ""The Wizard of Oz"" when Dorothy and her companions are beset by hostile trees in a dark, haunted forest. In a July 11, 1999 interview with the NY Daily News, co-director Myrick says, ""What [we] were going after was identifiability. . .Do you identify with the fear? Being lost in the woods, everyone's felt that."" Working on a shoe-string budget, the directors and cast improvised the dialog. They also worked in tense conditions not unlike those that the film's characters found themselves in. A Newsweek article on the film reports that ""Though the actors would pass an occasional jogger, they began to feel cut off from the safety of the civilized world."" Since the film has captured the imagination of the public despite lacking all of the accoutrements of blockbuster films--no film track, no special effects, no stars--many journalists and academics have looked closely at it to try to figure out what it reflects about American society. In an August 31, 1999 NY Times article on ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Sixth Sense"", another blockbuster horror movie, Robert Sklar, a New York University professor on the editorial board of the left-wing film magazine Cineaste, speculated that its popularity might be driven by unease about the millennium. People are ""spooked by all the things that are coming up at this time."" He added that the horror genre has always been cyclical, and that its moments of highest popularity have coincided with moments of extreme social and cultural dislocation. ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and ""Nosferatu"" were popular as silent films in Europe following the real horrors of World War I and Hollywood horror films such as ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"" made their mark in the early 1930's, when Americans were struggling with economic depression. In the 1950's, as Americans were troubled by the atomic age and the cold war, films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" depicted alien invaders, giant bugs and nuclear experiments gone awry. According to an August 22, 1999 article in the British Independent newspaper, Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California's School of Cinema and Television, believes that new interest in the horror genre is linked to America's geopolitical climate. When the enemy was more clearly defined, as in the case of the former Soviet Union, then the monsters in horror movies could be more clearly and logically. With the collapse of Communism, he maintains, ""You see the US in a bit of disarray in terms of self-representation ... The evil is not so clear in our imagination."" Boyd views the crude hand-held camerawork and lack of even rudimentary set designs as an attempt to control the technology that had been the province of Hollywood experts. ""By having fear 'in our own hands' rather than waiting for it to be evoked by visual or aural cues, we reassert some measure of power in an age of cynicism and impotency."" What such commentaries on the film seem to miss, however, is the importance of the forest in defining the film's attitude toward the supernatural. The forest, as much as the witch lurking within it, is a terrifying force, not unlike Moby Dick or Stephen Spielberg's Great White Shark in ""Jaws."" This is not the Arcadian ideal depicted in a Audubon Society calendar, but a hostile and unpredictable entity that can gobble you up with no warning. The young film-makers probably did not have this history in mind when they sat down to write the scenario for ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but for as long as humanity has considered its environment, the forest has often appeared as some kind of hostile force that needed to be subdued. Such fear of the woods had much to do with European hostility toward the American Indian who seemed not only at home there, but who felt no need to tame it. It is appropriate, therefore, in such mythology for a witch to reside in the forest since such a creature not only represents defiance of civilized Christian values, but a belief that we are part of nature ourselves. Engels writes in ""The Dialectics of Nature"": ""Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature -- but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly."" While I am writing this review, helicopters and trucks are spraying Malathion over the five boroughs of New York City in an effort to kill encephalitis-bearing mosquitoes. While city government officials claim that the insecticide is ""harmless,"" they urge New Yorkers to remain indoors while the spraying is in progress. Since the virus was early in August, mosquito experts around the country have been surprised and befuddled that St. Louis encephalitis has turned up so far north and east. But the environmentalist Rachel's Weekly (www.rachels.org) cites scientists who attribute northern migration of plants and animals to global warming. As northern regions become more like the south, mosquitoes that carry diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, and encephalitis extend their range, and move to higher elevations --thus threatening larger human populations with exposure to serious infectious diseases. Perhaps the insecurities about the forest in ""The Blair Witch Project"" are an unconscious projection of such real-life horrors, bred by a capitalist system run amok.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project (R) ** 1/2 Starring Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard Directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez A Review by Frankie Paiva If there is one film this summer (or any summer for that matter) besides Star Wars could possibly create more hype than this film I would give it a prize. What started out as a $35,000 dollar horror movie that could cover the fake Blair Witch, would turn into a phenomenon. Early buzz out of Sundance had people calling it the scariest film of all time, Artisan signed it that night for 1 million, and the launch of the Blair Witch site began. Generating a cult months before the movie opens rarely happens, but do to the fantastic webpage (www.blairwitch.com) which features all of the fake mythology, it had people hanging on the edge, waiting for the film to be released. ""The film cannot possibly live up to all of the hype that's been surrounding it."" That was a quote from George Lucas about Star Wars, and it's true here too. You know the story, three student filmmakers Heather, (Donahue) Michael, (Michael Williams) and Josh (Leonard) are out to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. Townspeople say she was old Ellie Keyward, accused of witchcraft she was banished in the 1800s. Every fourty years after that, mysterious things would happen. Disemboweled fisherman showed up at the river, children started going missing, and an old man says he was killing children because an old witch told him so. They of course get lost and start hearing weird noises at night. One of the crew goes missing, and what are all of those strange symbols that they keep finding all over the forest? The film does not live up to it's hype. I (and the 25 or so people that I've talked with that saw it) all agree that is wasn't scary at all. What is hyped to be the scariest film of all time didn't really inflict one twinge of pure terror. The camera technique is interesting though, if not sickening, and I'd like to see more films made that way. However do make sure to get a good night's rest before seeing the film, the camera shaking didn't make me sick at all, but it really made me sleepy. No, it's not ""Scary as Hell"" or is it ""An Instant Classic"" but I still reccomend you see Blair Witch which gets ** 1/2 stars.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"_The_Blair_Witch_Project_ (R) *** (out of ****) Spanning two centuries and encompassing (among other things) mysterious disappearances, gruesome acts of violence, a rare book, chilling film footage, and a legendary witch, the sprawling mythology that filmmakers Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez, Greg Hale, Rob Cowie, and Mike Monello have crafted around _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ is massive and murky enough to make _The_X-Files_ creator Chris Carter proud. It's almost a shame that the film that inspired it all barely scratches the surface of this elaborately constructed piece of modern folklore. Since unexpectedly jolting audiences at this year's Sundance Film Festival, _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ has been riding a wave of hype and high expectations leading to its July theatrical release. But the fact that _Blair_Witch_ is an ultra-low-budget indie doesn't make it any more immune to the inevitable feeling of disappointment that accompanies any studio-manufactured object of ballyhoo. Don't get me wrong; the well-made product is a testament to the triumph of imagination and creativity over financial limitations. But it functions more effectively as part of a larger multimedia entertainment experience than as a stand-alone film. The premise is simple enough that it is summed up in one tidy title card at the beginning of the picture: ""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers diappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found."" That faux vérité footage is what makes up _The_Blair_Witch_Project_, chronicling from the first person director Heather Donahue, sound guy Michael Williams, and cameraman Joshua Leonard's ill-fated filmic investigation into a legendary witch that haunts Burkittsville, formerly known as Blair. The project quickly turns from fun--such as interviewing sometimes wacky locals about the legend--to a harrowing struggle for survival as they become lost in the forest, where a mysterious force stalks the trio. Of course, we all know where this is going, thanks to that opening blurb. So it's up to writer-directors Myrick and Sanchez to come up with a compelling journey, and they largely succeed. The perpetually shaky camerawork is annoying at times, but it contributes to the film's greatest virtue--its air of authenticity. Adding to that is the use of unknown actors convincingly playing humanly imperfect characters named after themselves. The audience believes they are witnessing real people experiencing real pain, real frustration, and, ultimately, real fear. That sense of fear extends to the audience, but not quite as strongly as has been made out to be. There are two scenes in particular that struck me as particularly frightening, but that was about it, and they come fairly late in the game. In fact, _Blair_Witch_ in just in the midst of developing a head of steam when it ends. While the film concludes on an appropriately eerie and ambiguous note, its fairly abrupt nature is far from satisfying. For greater satisfaction, one must see the Sci-Fi Channel's forthcoming tie-in special on the _Blair_Witch_ legend or visit the website, which offers a wealth of information on the _Blair_Witch_ mythology, from the legend's origins to events that take place after those depicted in the film--not to mention the ""story"" behind the piecing together of the ""lost footage"" into the 87-minute film. A taste of this information is provided in the press notes, which I did not read until after the film. Reading them has indeed made the experience and understanding of the film a bit richer, but that doesn't change what is printed on the celluloid. As smartly conceived and executed as it is, _Blair_Witch_ the film is basically a fairly familiar tale of three people who must learn to live together and fend for themselves when lost in the forest. Which is basically to say that _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ isn't quite as special as it has been made out to be; it won't be the breakout hit Artisan Entertainment is hoping for, just a sizable arthouse success. This is not to say that the film is not worth a look; it is a diverting work of great ingenuity and invention. It's just that to appreciate the full breadth of the five filmmakers' vision, one must bone up on the supplemental materials. _Blair_Witch_ the film is ultimately as much of a teaser for its website as is vice versa.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has the bizarre distinction of being the first horror film ever to give me nightmares *before* having seen it. The nightmares will probably continue for awhile, even though BLAIR WITCH is not, contrary to the reports I've heard, the scariest movie ever made. Not even close. The conceit of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is this: Three eager filmmakers go into the woods of Maryland in search of material for a project about `The Blair Witch,' a supposed woman who was exiled from the town of Blair during the witch trial era. And today, the Blair Witch continues to ply her trade, as interviews at the film's beginning make clear  stories of massacred children and haunted houses have left a lasting impression on the residents of Burkittsville (formerly Blair, MD). All of this sets the stage for us, plus a textual prologue telling us that these filmmakers vanished, and what we are watching is the footage they shot, discovered in the woods a year later. So we know up front that something evil is afoot, and in the 90 minutes of `discovered footage' we get to see plenty of it. The trouble starts when the trio gets lost, and their turmoil gets worse every day (as they seem to be hiking in circles) and every night, when ... something begins playing cruel tricks on them. Captured on videotape, black and white 16mm, and (I think) color 8mm, BLAIR WITCH is compelling as a faux documentary. (And yes, *none* of this is true, although most of the people in line and sitting around us weren't aware of that.) But is this movie scary? In a word, and on the whole, no. Possibly a victim of its own hype, like STAR WARS, BLAIR WITCH has plenty of atmosphere and creepy scenes (mostly unseen voices in the woods), but it isn't that frightening. My wife is a big wimp, and she only grabbed my arm twice. Not until the grand finale does the WITCH trot out the Big Guns, and I will admit that the final images on screen are some of the scariest I've ever seen. Still, two minutes of footage does not a stellar movie make. The other 88 are okay, and often funny, but it ain't horror. However, for the horror buff or indie film fan, this is a great example of something, well, off the beaten path.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Starring Heather Donahue; Michael C. Williams; Joshua Leonard; Bob Griffin & Jim King To all of those ""respected"" critics out there who used words and phrases like ""terrifying"", ""bone chilling"", ""the scariest movie ever"" and other such expressions which lend themselves well to a movie advertisement, I have only one question. Is this the first horror movie that you have ever seen? Obviously for those of you who found it so terrifying, your only previous ""horror"" experiences must have come courtesy of old Scooby-Doo reruns. I guarantee you that if you had ever set foot in the horror section of your local video store you would have realized that this was far from a scary movie. But I guess for some people, jumping on the old ""Blair Witch Bandwagon"" was more important than writing a credible review. This movie ranked a 3 out of 10 for me. And to be honest, none of that is for the scare factor in this movie. For those of you that have been living in a cave the past little while, here is a recap of the basic plot of the movie. The story goes that three documentary filmmakers went out into the Maryland woods looking for evidence of a local legend. This legend is a ghost known as the Blair Witch. The filmmakers went into the woods never to be heard from again. But, some time later, their equipment was found -- including their cameras and all of the footage that they shot before vanishing. This film has been compiled into the movie we now see as The Blair Witch Project. I'll say right off the bat that this is a very cool idea. So much so, that some people actually believed that this was real documentary footage that they were watching in theaters. This is of course due, in no small part, to the incredible marketing that this movie got. The hype that surrounded this movie, specifically over the Internet, before it opened was nothing short of a phenomenon. Considering that this movie was reportedly made for something in the 40 thousand-dollar range and grossed hundreds of millions in theaters, the marketing campaign would have to be classed as an unqualified success. Sadly, like many things in life, just because there is a huge amount of hype, doesn't mean that there is actually anything good behind that hype. The Blair Witch Project does not even come close to living up to its advance word. Leaving me to wonder who exactly it was that had all these glowing things to say about the movie. Regardless, I'm glad I didn't actually pay to see this thing in a theater. I'm even happier that when I saw it on video, I didn't pay for that either. About the only part of this movie that even got close to what I would call eerie was the final sequence in the movie. I'm certainly not about to spoil the ending, but suffice to say that if you feel the urge to abandon ship halfway through the movie you won't be missing anything. That also goes for the ""newly discovered footage"" which has been tacked on after the credits in the Home video versions. What a waste of about 5 minutes that was. The scariest part of the movie is the now famous close-up shot of star Heather Donahue looking into the camera and saying how scared she is. It is only scary because we get an extreme close-up view up her nostrils. There should be a law against such things. Then we have the much-publicized camerawork that reportedly made some people physically ill in theaters. Sorry, don't buy it. Sure the angles were herky jerky, but there was nothing present that would make anyone ill who was not already suffering from an acute case of the stomach flu. I expected the lousy camera work and the black and white photography going in, so that, for the most part, didn't annoy me. But there were parts that did qualify as downright frustrating. In one scene ""the witch"" leaves a bundle of sticks with something inside it. Donahue's character opens it and goes into hysterics. The camera focus is so fuzzy that we can only see that whatever it is looks to be bloody, but nothing more. So we have no idea why she is so upset. The scares are like this the whole movie. The actors are running around terrified, but we, the audience, never quite get why they are so upset. They get all terrified when a pile of stones appears outside their tent. Weird, I'll grant you, but I would have been a little more unnerved if someone had been hurling them at my tent and not piling them outside it. But nobody said that these characters were that bright. They hear strange noises in the middle of the night. (Noises in the woods -- go figure.) They run off blindly into the woods and sit in the dark. Call me crazy, but if I think something might potentially attack me, I've got every light available on. I'd have the whole place lit up like Christmas tree, not sit around in the dark waiting for whatever it was to sneak up on me. This also leads to the added annoyance of having protracted sequences where the screen is totally dark with the characters whispering back and forth to each other -- very annoying. One nice touch was the fact that there was no soundtrack to this movie, which did give it more of an ""authentic"" feel about it. I almost wonder if a little mood music might not have improved things. I have to give the actors credit. There was very little script involved in the making of this movie. The three were sent out into the woods where they would be left notes as to the basic that their characters were to perform. The rest is improv. And considering what they had to work with, I think that they did a hell of a good job. To be fair, considering that the three actors not only were the cast, but also doubled as the crew, the film turned out pretty well. I'm certainly not faulting the ingenious ideas or methods used in the production of this film. What I am faulting is that this movie is billed as a horror, but it just isn't scary. Not in the least. The Blair Witch Project may make for an interesting topic for discussion in some university film class, but it sure won't make you spill your popcorn while you are jumping out of your seat. I think my brother summed it up best as the end credits started to roll. He said: They shouldn't be giving us the credits, they should be giving us an apology. Truer words were never spoken. 3/10 -- For the concept; the marketing; and the acting The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard Written and Directed by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Running Time: 87 minutes Date Reviewed: August 3, 1999 ***Be warned... the following review contains some harsh language*** The Blair Witch Project. Quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time. If you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace, because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy. My colleague and friend Chuck Dowling wrote that if less is more, then the Blair Witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more. And this worked for him. Well, I'm sorry, but nothing... is NOTHING!!!!! NOTHING IS NOT MORE. IT'S NOTHIIIIIINGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!. I do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing. ""Nothing"" is free, available all around the world at a location near you. I am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary. I could just discount them and say, ""Well, I guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow."" But I have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water. There must be some other reason. (Then again, maybe my first thought is correct, I think I'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction.) When I hear people praising this film, I never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie: three kids bickering with each other about being lost. They only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time. This being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout ""Josh!!"" over and over. This film should not be called The Blair Witch Project, it should more accurately be called THREE DUMB AND PISSPOOR FILMMAKERS GET LOST... AND ARGUE WITH EACH OTHER. Oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting ""Josh!!"". And if you thought that was scary, wait till you see a pile of rocks, and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs, oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear. Oh yeah, and some goo on one of their backpacks. You've never seen terror like this folks, and you don't want to. The Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn comedy Foul Play is creepier than this film. (For current films, I highly recommend The Sixth Sense or A Stir of Echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience.) This film is an example of marketing with no substance. The marketing was brilliant, and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film. They want this film to be good. And I think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise. That wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along, but this is not it. This film could have been SO much better. Just think, if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost, and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff. I saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it. She was sold on this film. And then, at one point during it, she turned to me and asked '...are we supposed to be scared by this?'. I've heard one opinion that you ""have to use your imagination"" to create the fear in this movie. Well, I thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do. Use THEIR imagination and create a good movie. I mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it. But even if you like this idea, then what are you imagining? An entity called the blair witch? Some rednecks fucking with these kids? Are either of these things really scary when you think about it??? I've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something. Well sure thats scary in real life, but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting. You could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary, but in a film it wouldn't be. And no, a movie does not need a big budget or CGI special effects to be scary or creepy. Actually the less the better (see the equally awful remake of The Haunting). But you have to do SOMETHING. You cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this COULD BE SCARY, if it were real. And by the way, about the shakycam filming in Blair Witch. Aren't these supposed to be ""filmmakers"" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly? I'm not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified, that's justified. I'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot anything smoothly at all. Minor quibble there. There is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers. That the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank. And I think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves ""what was I thinking??"". But, if they don't, then thats fine. If it works for them then that's okay I guess. I just lament that by making this movie a hit, we are going to be subjected to more of the ""nothing is more"" approach. Pretty soon we're going to get some movies like this: just a still shot of a prison jail cell. For 90 minutes. And we'll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves, ""my god, wouldn't it be scary to spend life in prison?!! This movie is the scariest movie of all time!!!!!"". Or, a shot of a coffin, with some funeral directors arguing with each other. ""Man, do you know how scary it would be to die???!!!! Now THIS is the scariest movie of all time!!!!""

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT Rating: ***1/2 (out of four) R, 1999 Directors/Screenplay: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Starring Cast: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams Almost everyone predicted that cinema in 1999 would be the year of Lucas and Kubrick, but few would have guessed ahead of time that one of the most talked-about films of the year after THE PHANTOM MENACE and EYES WIDE SHUT would be a micro-budget horror film called THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The film was made (do I even need to repeat this story?) on a budget of $37,000 and boasts an intriguing premise: it claims to be the footage, only recently discovered, shot by three film students who disappeared in the woods near a small town called Burkittsville while making a documentary about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch."" This is, of course, a piece of fiction, though reportedly much of what we see was improvised on the spot by the three actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, all using their real names), who really did shoot the footage themselves and who were given only a broad outline by co-writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. Since the scenes were filmed by the actors, with the directors waiting off-camera and out of sight, there are no special effects or scenes of gruesome murder in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and the witch herself never actually appears on-screen. The ""horror"" rests instead on slowly escalating psychological tension, as the students become lost in the woods, their map disappears, and unseen menaces seem to draw nearer. They seem to be surrounded by strange noises at night whose origins they cannot determine, and in the morning, ominous-looking stick figures made of twigs and leaves are found outside their tent. One night, children's voices are heard outside and their tent suddenly collapses on them, but when they run outside, there is no one in sight. As their situation grows more desperate, they start to turn against each other and lay blame for their predicament, mostly on Heather, who had conceived of the project and who insisted beyond all reason that they were not lost. John Carpenter said once that horror revolves around the loss of control, and Myrick and Sanchez seem to understand that. Until the last five minutes, the overall effect of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is more disturbing than it is ""scary"" in the way the word is typically understood. Since none of the apparent supernatural elements are ever witnessed on screen, there are very few moments that are likely to make the audience jump out of their seats in fright. Instead, we come to empathize with the three characters as they endure day after day that is dominated by fear and confusion; what the film lacks in visceral thrills is compensated for by the human tragedy that plays itself out. Towards the end, Heather records a tearful apology to Josh's and Mike's families as well as her own and accepts responsibility for the untimely end which she knows they will soon meet. This scene is matched in power perhaps only by the final five minutes, which will truly scare many viewers witless and which end with an ambiguous but unsettling visual that will not easily be forgotten. All three performers pull off their roles almost flawlessly. Heather is perhaps the most interesting of the trio, as her later need to put some sort of emotional distance between herself and the increasingly grim situation accounts partly for the fact that the entire ordeal is caught on camera. Even when they are hopelessly lost and running out of food, she insists that they keep filming, and Josh, who had earlier screamed at her to turn the camera off, later takes a look through the lens and tells her he understands, because watching through the camera rather than through one's own eyes is ""not quite reality."" She is also the most flawed of the three, as it was her initial overconfidence that led indirectly to their predicament. Both Josh and Mike are also quite believable and sympathetic, though the way in which one of them is revealed as being responsible for the map disappearing doesn't really work: it strikes me as an amazingly boneheaded stunt, however frustrated the guilty party may have been. I don't know if there's really much of a theme or a point to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT aside from some fairly routine ""humankind's arrogance in overstepping its boundaries"" implications. It's a story that exists mostly for its own sake, as an experiment in blending two cinematic approaches that are usually incompatible, i.e. the supernatural thriller and the verisimilitude of a pseudo-documentary. On this level, however, it does definitely succeed. There is never the sense that we are watching actors perform a scene, and the supernatural elements are necessarily implied rather than shown (an appearance by a CGI-rendered Blair Witch would have turned the whole thing into a long joke with a bad punchline). The key to the film's success is the realization that, for the most part, stories sink or swim with their characters. By giving the protagonists center stage and keeping the spooks off-screen, Myrick and Sanchez have made THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT into a film that is not only disturbing and occasionally downright chilling, but tragic and empathetic as well. It's a bold debut, and I would be surprised if I see a better horror film any time soon.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"MY QUITE LENGTHY TAKE ON THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT When a variety of credible critics claim that a new horror movie is one of the scariest they've ever seen, I make plans to see it. That's just how it works. I love a good horror movie (sometimes even a bad one) and if a movie really is scary, I want to experience it. However, the film festival and promotional screening buzz of the Blair Witch Project has grown to such a deafening roar that it seems inevitable that it won't live up to the hype. ""It couldn't be as scary as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" I told myself, ""But hopefully it will be good."" At least in the circles I travel, The Blair Witch Project is easily one of the most anticipated summer movies of '99. Everyone wants to see if it lives up to the hype - will it be another out of nowhere, low budget first feature horror classic, like Night of the Living Dead or Texas Chain Saw Massacre or The Evil Dead? Artisan Entertainment has cruelly but cleverly used this anticipation as a promotional gimmick by going ahead and releasing it on a mere 27 screens nationwide. The scene at the Neptune in Seattle is, I would assume, typical - the box office swarmed all day, every single show selling out hours in advance, enormous around-the-block lines completely unprecedented for this one screen, semi-arthouse theater. And while I was waiting in line two hours in advance for a 9:45 showing, clutching tickets I had bought at 3 in the afternoon, people would walk by, see the lines and exclaim variations on ""This must be the movie of the summer."" No doubt these people will check the movie out ""when the crowds die down"" and it's playing in multiplexes. Another thing that has apparently helped to promote the film is the ""let's pretend it's real"" approach to some of the marketing. I never thought the web site or other promotional materials were intended to deceive people into thinking the Blair Witch was real. Nevertheless, I heard the guy behind me in line telling a long, fanciful story about how the filmmakers were found dismembered and the footage was buried in someone's backyard and blah blah blah. Other people were overheard referring to it as a ""true story."" (I can't help but suspect that these are the people who will be most disappointed by the movie. They ought to realize it's a ""hoax"" as soon as it ends - would a real snuff film have credits?) The premise of the movie, as you surely must know, is that three student filmmakers venture into the woods to make an amateur documentary about a local legend involving a witch and a series of child murders. The filmmakers, we are told by the opening title, disappeared, and one year later their footage was found. We watch their black and white 16 mm footage and goofing-around digital video, edited together to tell the story of their experiences getting lost in the woods. Early on, I was skeptical as to whether the found-footage conceit would work. They interview some locals about the ""Blair Witch"" legend, and the very first interview is rather stiff. The director of the film within the film, Heather, records some narration in a cemetery, and it's almost too bad to be believed. She changes her accent to sound more serious, and the results are laughable. (Otherwise, the amateurishness of the documentary-in-progress seems dead on accurate. I am absolutely positive that the aspiring filmmakers I went to college with would have taken the same approach - static, black and white 16 mm for the ""scary parts,"" plus lots of crappy video footage of the filmmakers hiking and fooling around in the hotel room.) But the film quickly won me over, and I found that there were very few touches that rang false. Almost none of the dialogue seems like it could have possibly been scripted (apparently, the directors led the actors on sort of a role-playing scavenger hunt, leading them through the story with a series of notes). As far as I can tell, most of the characterization is not so much storytelling as footage of the actual bonding between the actors. They joke with each other in ways rarely captured on film before - not clever quips, just the kinds of things people say to each other when they're hanging out together. One of my favorite such moments is when Michael jokingly reprimands Heather and Josh for incorrectly referring to the Skipper on Gilligan's Island. ""Let's stop calling him 'The Captain,' you illiterate TV people. It's *the Skipper*."" What results from this improvisatory technique is perhaps the most realistic group of protagonists in horror movie history. I can relate to the heroes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or Dawn of the Dead, but not as effortlessly as I can here. The clever quasi-Method techniques used to get these performances really help pull you into the movie. These are real people, really reacting - it's just that what they're reacting to, of course, isn't real. But suspension of disbelief was not a problem for me. I felt like I really was going to ""shoot doc"" with these people, and then getting lost in the woods with them, and then running blindly through the trees screaming with them. One particularly realistic touch is the way the fear slowly builds throughout the movie. Some horror movies have their protagonists take their situations too lightly, like when Jennifer Love Hewitt goes tanning shortly after witnessing murders in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. But I think most horror filmmakers, had they made The Blair Witch Project, would have had the protagonists terrified out of their minds for the last two thirds of the movie, giving it a melodramatic feel that probably would not have worked. The film, however, allows the characters to feel better when the daylight comes. They may have witnessed something spooky last night in the dark, but in the sunny afternoon everything seems safer. They allow themselves to rationalize what happened, or to put it out of their minds, or to assume that they can make it out of the woods before darkness hits again. For a long time, they assume it's just someone trying to scare them, which still scares them because ""something has to be wrong"" with someone who would bother to do that. But as the film progresses, the situation gets worse, the nights get scarier and the chances of ever finding the edge of the woods begin to seem miniscule. It's a slow burn. Rather than start out with something scary, then introduce the characters, then get scary again, The Blair Witch Project starts out funny and really has to build toward the scary. And it works. I don't want to say that The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The more times people say that, the more the expectations are built, and there will most certainly be people who see it years later and have heard for so long how scary it is that when they finally see it, it seems laughable. But the fact is, a movie has never before scared me the way this one did. Maybe The Shining or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre would have done the trick if I had seen them for the first time at the right age and in a theater. Or maybe The Exorcist, had I grown up Catholic. Only time travel will ever settle that. But when shit went down in the Burkittsville woods, I felt a powerful, vibrating chill all across my skin - the same feeling you get when you almost get hit by a car or otherwise feel just a little too close to death. My girlfriend and I like to watch horror movies together, and she usually squeezes my hand tight during the scary scenes. This is the first movie that has prompted her to bite my finger in fear. Many hardened skeptics and contrarians are already popping up to claim that it's all hype, and that the movie actually isn't at all scary. I don't think many of them could have been at the 9:45 Neptune show, though. Throughout the film, people all around me were looking at the film intellectually, or just not taking it seriously. As the opening text unfolded, the guy next to me continued a conversation with his girlfriend about some Buffalo Springfield song that they had been reminded of by one of the trailers. Later he said out loud, ""That's a scary shot,"" dissecting the movie, probably an aspiring filmmaker. Even late in the film, when things had gotten real scary and uncomfortable, the theater would rumble with laughter every time a character made a semi-amusing comment. It didn't seem like the kind of audience that could be terrified by a movie. But at a certain point late in the movie, when the protagonists stumble upon a certain thing, I heard an entire packed theater get scared out of their wits. This is not a sudden jolt or a blunt scare like a dead body or a pool of blood. It's just the unexpected discovery of something that at this point in the story makes the audience fear what might happen next. A massive, communal moan of dread rumbled back and forth between the walls of the theater. You could hear the entire audience squirm in unison. This is not the ""BOO! Made you flinch,"" type of shock that is so prevalent in modern horror films. This is more like true blue, horrified, horrible, reeling in horror type of horror. I wonder if this might be the closest I'll get to ever experiencing something like the terror that people allegedly had when The Exorcist was first released. So why is it so scary? It's not virtuoso cinematic technique, or pushing the boundaries of horror subject matter. I think what the filmmakers did was push aside most of what they've seen in horror movies and instead try to imagine what it would really be like in real life. What would really be scary? A guy with an ax chopping off a guy's head? Yeah, that would be scary. But what about something more subtle? Like, just hearing footsteps when you're out where there shouldn't be people? In a slick studio horror movie, the idea would be ludicrous. But in a raw, low budget movie that so unerringly captures reality, it wrenches your stomach. What's wrong with today's horror movies, many people have tried to convince me, is that they show too much, when the real way to make a movie scary is to leave everything up to the imagination. I think that's overstating the argument, though. Yes, some of the most horrifying events in, say, Psycho, take place off screen. You can't really deny that Jaws and Alien wouldn't be less scary if their respective creatures had much more screen time. And I think it is notable how many people remember horrendous amounts of blood and bodily mutilation in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even though the actual movie is virtually bloodless. But just because it works so well in these classics doesn't mean it's the only legitimate approach to making a horror film. Would Night of the Living Dead be scarier without the shot of the zombies munching guts? Was I imagining it when I thought the gruesome bloodletting and eye-munching tarantulas of The Beyond made my heart beat fast? Would The Exorcist be scarier if we had to imagine Regan turning her head around? I don't think so. But The Blair Witch Project takes the other approach - leaving it to the imagination - and succeeds tremendously. I am certain that it will become the most frequently used example of the ""tell, don't show"" technique of horror. The premise of Blair Witch Project allows a good twist on being Left To The Imagination (for now on, to be referred to as LTTI). Since the film pretends to be an attempt to document actual horrific events, the audience is made to feel like they are examining the footage, squinting at it, trying to find the evidence in there somewhere. When something happens off screen, you don't think, ""Nice cinematic technique."" It's more like, ""Damn, they didn't have the camera on."" Like real videos of alleged supernatural phenomenon, the eeriness of the footage largely lies in how frustratingly incomplete it is. You're always searching for a quick glimpse of something, somewhere in the frame. In the instances when you do see something horrifying, the camera is shaky and unclear enough that it's debatable what you saw. Even the eerie sounds heard in the night are largely LTTI, because they are covered by the ruffling microphones and unzipping tents of the terrified film crew. I didn't even notice it until after the movie, but I think the lack of music really helps, and almost falls into the LTTI category. A good score can really add a lot to a horror film, particularly those of the atmospheric, gothic variety. There are terrifying movies that don't work at all when viewed without the music, like (according to John Carpenter) Halloween. But Blair Witch Project has no music to poke at your emotions, or enhance the creepiness, or tell you how to feel. The story is left to fend for itself. Even the end credits, thankfully, don't try to cheer you up or appeal to your sense of irony with a catchy tune. Instead, they leave you with ambient noises, as if to say, ""Keep thinking about it, sucker. This movie isn't leaving right away."" So since the movie really does live up to the hype, and since the overwhelming crowds of the limited release seem to be a genuine phenomenon, I think it's safe to say that The Blair Witch Project will be a monster hit that will signal a new era in horror films. Perfect timing, too, because the short lived Scream cycle seems to be on its last legs. Hugely successful horror films always inspire a slew of half-assed imitators that miss the point, and a few pretty good ones that don't. It will be interesting to see how studios and other filmmakers will try to capitalize on and/or learn from The Blair Witch Project. Here are a few predictions: 1. Much lip service will be given to the LTTI technique. This week, Dreamworks releases Jan De Bont's effects heavy remake of the LTTI classic The Haunting. I predict that 75% of all reviews will mention The Blair Witch Project as a superior alternative, because it doesn't try to show everything. Perhaps some of the next slew of horror films will put more thought into the ancient art of making the audience fear what they might see, instead of what they do see. 2. One or two studios will try picking up low budget supernatural horror movies by unknown directors. They will be met with much less enthusiasm than The Blair Witch Project. 3. Someone will try making a movie with a Scream style, plucked-from-TV cast encountering a supernatural horror in the woods. The trades will call it ""The Blair Witch Project meets Scream."" 4. I fear that particularly unimaginative filmmakers will try copying the mockumentary angle. Blair Witch Project isn't the first horror movie to do this, but another horror mockumentary inspired by its success would still count as a rip off. Other filmmakers will have trouble duplicating the realism of Blair Witch Project. 5. Hopefully, the movie's success will inspire filmmakers to think about what really is scary, rather than what is traditionally used to scare people in horror films. They will probe their own fears and try to figure out how to depict them realistically on film. I don't think they should abandon the use of extravagant visual effects, but it should free them up to realize that audiences don't need them. A postscript concerning The Blair Witch Project and my precious Texas Chain Saw Massacre: Although the films are very different from each other, it is my belief that BWP was heavily influenced by 'Saw, from the opening text implying (but not outright stating) that the story is true, to certain witchly artifacts reminiscent of the dangling bone ornaments in 'Saw, to the ambiguous marketing which has confused people into believing BWP is a true story. There are still many people who mistakenly believe 'Saw is based on a true story (Ed Gein, who didn't live in Texas and had no chainsaw to massacre with, doesn't count). After 'Saw, director Tobe Hooper went on to make one unacknowledged classic (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2), one above average sleaze thriller (The Funhouse), and one mainstream success that most people credit to Steven Spielberg (Poltergeist). Most of the rest of his output has been either substandard horror with limited appeal (Eaten Alive), or unmitigated crap (Spontaneous Combustion, The Mangler). I still hope he will someday recapture the demented magic of his two 'Saw films, but most write him off as the director of a fluke one-off. I hope Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, the creators of The Blair Witch Project, don't suffer the Curse of Tobe Hooper. So far, the odds seem against them. Much of the strength of BWP lies in the mockumentary gimmick, which one would hope they won't repeat. But we don't know if these guys know anything about other forms of cinematic storytelling, or directing scripted actors, or even writing dialogue. On the other hand, we do know that these are clever guys who came up with an original way to film an extremely effective horror movie. Here's hoping they have more tricks up their sleeves.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The movie: 3 and a half dried twigs (out of 4) The movie, plus the website, plus the featurette: 4 dried twigs (out of 4) Directed by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (II) Written by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (II) Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard But, you've got to hand it to them, the folks behind ""The Blair Witch Project"" were. With no money or name actors, writer-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (II) got clever, and created an event bigger than the actuality of their film. The story of the film is best encapsulated by the words that appear before the footage begins: ""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers dissapeared in the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. One year later, their footage was found."" Now that is a good premise for a horror story. The ensuing tension and revelations are worth the price of admission. Debuting their film at midnight during the Sundance film festival, Myrick and Sanchez scared the bejeezus out of an indy-film crowd with an unexpectedly well made, scary film project. The Sundance buzz was ignited, but the duo did not stop there. They went on to create a wonderful web-site that tells much of the history of the film's story and paired up with the Sci-Fi channel to create a ""Blair Witch Project"" documentary, ""The Mythology of Blair Witch."" By the time the actualy film was released (to only one theater in the D.C. area!) my desire to know the story and learn the secrets that film contained were greater than ever. I was as anxious to see the footage as I was to see *GASP* ""Episode One."" This is a very well made, very clever film. The real question is, ""Is it scary?"" Yes, it is scary. ""Is it the scariest movie you've ever seen?"" It was pretty intense. I think, though, that ""Schindler's List"" ranks up there on the actual fear meter. On the other hand, this movie is not meant to preach, it is meant to scare. It may be a post-haunted house ""I'm no coward"" mentality that leads me to say that it wasn't too terribly scary. However, I can say that my mind was haunted on the drive home; to the extent of turning off the radio and picturing the film's final images again and again to try to discern exactly what it was that occurred. In reality, the movie is really little more than a documentary style ghost story told with a lot of screaming, a teensy bit of fake blood and a couple of shaky cameras. The media hoopla has described the style of the film as a necessity because of the project's low budget, but I don't believe that this film would have been as effective any other way. The casting of unknown actors -- Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard (playing themselves) -- closed the gap between reality and fantasy. The camera's blurred images and distant sound (sometimes the sound you hear was captured by the video camera, and sometimes by DAT) make you believe that this is actually happening as documented by the machinery. And, perhaps most effective of all, is the lack of a clear picture of whatever it is that's happening. In an age when filmmakers are being encouraged to dream their most fantastic digital dreams for their audience, these two filmmakers were forced to look into the negative space of our psyches and remember that what we don't know is the source of true magic and terror. Thank you to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, along with your cast and crew, for creating excitement about an innovative vision and a film that mostly achieves its own hype.

"Blair Witch Project, The",Horror,2020,"The Blair Witch Project Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez Starring Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard Official Sites: http://www.blairwitch.com/ (mythology-recommended!) http://www.artisanent.com/blairwitch/ (trailers, screensavers, comic book, etc.) http://www.blairwitchdirect.com/ (merchandise) Grade: A- Horror films have often proven that Less is More. Many classics of the genre have been made on relatively small budgets: ""The Last House on the Left,"" ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""Halloween."" Even ""Psycho"" could join the list; Alfred Hitchcock chose to make his first true horror film on a small budget to limit studio interference. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's low-budget indie ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the ultimate expression of the Less is More principle. It follows this rule not only in its method of production but also in what it shows-or, more accurately, doesn't show-the audience. By now, you've read the words that open ""The Blair Witch Project."" They appear on the posters, on the webpages, and in the trailers: One year later their footage was found. The movie the follows is supposed to be the recovered footage that three college students-Heather, Mike, and Josh (apparently using their real names)-made as a project for their film class. Their subject is the local legend of the Blair Witch, a ghostly figure who lives deep in the Black Hills Forest and inspires the murders of children. After some preliminary interviews with Burkittsville (formerly Blair) residents about the legend, the trio sets out into the woods armed with a Hi-8 video camera, a CP-16 film camera loaded with black & white film, DAT sound equipment, and camping gear. For the first quarter of the film the three students have a lot of fun playing with their equipment. They record themselves drinking, film a study of Mike's sporadic chest hair, and try to catch Heather peeing. This is all so real that it's almost tedious except for the ominous knowledge that they won't be coming back from this trip. Before long, they're lost in the woods, and the map is gone. There are terrifying noises in the night and ritualistic warnings to leave. Unlike most teens in horror films, these three would be happy to leave if they could only find the way back. After seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I'm not surprised that recent exit polls have shown widespread audience dissatisfaction. It's an experimental film, and it doesn't offer what the average moviegoer is seeking. When I saw the ending I was initially disappointed myself, but my reaction was the result of mistaken expectations. To continue this line of discussion, I have to wander in to SPOILER territory, kids. So, you might want to TURN BACK NOW. Watching ""Blair Witch"" can be as frustrating as it is frightening. What we see and hear is what would be recorded by three amateur filmmakers out in the woods. Most of the movie is shot by Heather with the small video camera which lacks the definition we usually see in theatrical releases. Some shots are out of focus, others are shot in total darkness. The sounds in the distance are hard to make out. Important events happen when the cameras aren't running. Most frustrating of all for many horror fans, we don't see the witch. In ""Danse Macabre,"" Stephen King said that one of the most terrifying monsters can be ""the monster behind the door."" He cautioned, though, that the writer can never open that door because regardless of how awful the actual monster is, the reader was expecting something worse. However, the recent reactions to ""Blair Witch"" suggest that not opening the door may leave the audience just as disappointed, especially in a visual medium like film. So, where do I get off giving it an A-? Partly because I admire its audacity. Making a movie that suggests rather than shows takes guts. The choice to film most of the movie with a small camcorder is not only brave but also clever; in part, ""Blair Witch"" is an examination of the technology that liberates creativity (with video cameras widely available, almost anybody can make a movie) but also obscures as much as it reveals (details in the movie's low-definition video images are difficult to decipher). >From Blair Witch's internet promotion, I expected a movie with the raw intensity and gut-wrenching imagery of ""The Last House on the Left"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" However, that's not what ""Blair Witch"" offers. It has only the slightest touch of gore and violence. However, ""Blair Witch"" still packs a punch-it's just that its intensity lies in the subtle way it works on the viewer's mind rather than in horrific images. While I was watching the movie, I did not think it had affected me at all, but when I got home I turned on the lights in every room. The effect lasted until the next night. An really good horror film doesn't just scare you; it crawls inside your head and rearranges the wiring. One last aspect of interest: ""The Blair Witch Project"" takes a step toward the interactive multimedia that will doubtless be the dominant artform of the next century. It's website <http://www.blairwitch.com/> takes the position that all of the events depicted in the film are true and expands on the mythology of the Blair Witch legend and on the search for the missing filmmakers. It offers photos of and interviews with characters who don't appear in the film and even Real Video of television coverage of the search. The mythology will be further explored in a television documentary (""The Curse of the Blair Witch"" on the Sci-Fi Channel), a ""true crime"" book, and a comic book. In other words, the movie is only part of a larger work. That is a situation quite different from the familiar pattern of a movie based on a novel or a comic book adaptation of a movie; those ""tie-ins"" retell the same story in a different format. Expect to see more movie/book/web/video projects which ask the audience to explore different forms of media to get the whole story and which give the viewer more choice in how to conduct that exploration.

Little Women,Drama,2019,"At their best, family-oriented stories should have the same depth and intelligence of those that are intended primarily for adults. The makers of the latest film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN recognized the intelligence in the story and have created a very literate and mature film. The film is full of wonderful characters and situations that should appeal to everyone whether young or old, male or female. The film lovingly presents a few years in the lives of the March family, led by Marmie (Susan Sarandon) the poor but loving mother of four daughters. Most of the film centers around Jo (Winona Ryder), the strong-willed daughter who hopes to one day become a writer. The other daughters are romantic Meg (Trini Alvarado), quietly contented Beth (Claire Danes), and artistic Amy (played early in the film by Kirstin Dunst and later portrayed by Samantha Mathis). The film also introduces us to three key men in the lives of the March family: Thomas ""Laurie"" Lawrence (Christian Bale), the boy next door who becomes the sister's closest outside friend; Laurie's tutor (Eric Stoltz) who captures Meg's heart; and finally a German professor (Gabriel Byrne) who meets Jo in New York and encourages her to write from her heart. It is initially tempting to say that LITTLE WOMEN does not have much of a story, but that really isn't accurate. The story here simply follows the lives of a group of believable and realistic characters. The film never seems overplotted or allows the story to overwhelm the characterizations. By the end of the film, the characters all seem like very real people and we have seen an interesting portion of their lives. I have never read Alcott's original novel so I don't know how much she balanced the time given to each of the sisters. For this adaptation, screenwriter Robin Swicord and director Gillian Armstrong selected to focus the majority of their attention on Jo. This turns out to be a wise decision, providing the film with a strong central focus by allowing the audience to see the other characters mainly through her eyes. Occasional voice-over narration is used to strengthen the feeling that Jo is telling us the story. This focus on Jo places a lot of importance on Winona Ryder's performance. Ryder gives an Oscar-worthy performance, which is a large part of the reason why the film works so well. Over the last several years, Ryder has established herself as one of the most distinguished actors of her generation. She has been courageous with her selection of roles and she is just as good in period roles such as this as she is in more contemporary films. Ryder brings a great deal of strength, intelligence and determination to her performance as Jo. Her Jo is something of a tomboy, but also has a definite feminine side that she doesn't hesitate to show when appropriate. One of Ryder's greatest strenghts as an actress is her very expressive face that allows her to often convey much more then just the simple, literal meaning of her dialog. This is a skill that is put to good use a number of times in this film. There is one scene in particular late in the film where her facial expression adds a bunch of additional meaning to a very simple one-line answer to a question. This generated a strongly positive reaction from the audience at the screening I attended. Ryder's performance as Jo provides an interesting contrast to her Oscar-nominated performance in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. Both films take place in similar periods and concentrate quite a bit on societal roles (particularly for women). In the earlier film, Ryder's character seemed outwardly innocent and naive as she went along with the rules of society while subtlely showing that she was aware of, and even controlling, everything that was going on. As Jo, she is much more vocal about her feelings as she frequently and consciously goes against society's expectations. Comparing these two exceptional performances strongly illustrates Ryder's impressive range. While Ryder tends to dominate the film, several of the other actors are also able to make strong impressions. As the one sister who is most torn between the traditions of society and the desire for a more liberated life, Trini Alvarado's Meg shows some interesting inner conflicts. In her own way, she bucks tradition just like her sisters. Claire Danes (who is so good on the vastly underappreciated TV series ""My So-Called Life"") gives the film's most subtle performance. Beth's ambitions in life are less grand than those of her sisters, but she is able to quietly find her own form of happiness. When her life starts to take a tragic turn of direction late in the film, Danes is given some interesting opportunities to shine. Amy ends up being the film's weakest character. In the first part of the film, she is very well-played by Kirstin Dunst (the young vampire in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE) who brings a lot of spunk and sparkle to the role. About two-thirds of the way through the film, there is a four-year jump forward in time and Samantha Mathis takes over the role. At this point, the four sisters go their separate ways and the film (wisely) continues to concentrate primarily on Jo. Unfortunately, this leaves Mathis with very little time to make much of an impression. There really isn't anything seriously wrong with Mathis' performance, but it is jarring to have the sudden shift in actors (particularly since Dunst's performance is a hard act to follow) and the movie never fully overcomes this. Susan Sarandon does not have a lot of screen time as Marmie, but she gives her usual skilled performance. Her character is unusually liberated for her time, but she never seems anachronistic. It is clear that she is very *aware* of the customs of the time, but simply does not fully believe in some of them. Sarandon portrays Marmie as a stern parent who is also clearly very loving and fair. It is very easy to understand why her daughters respect her and it is also clear that the respect is mutual. Other than the Marchs, the most visible character in the film is Laurie. Ever since his stunning debut performance in Steven Spielberg's EMPIRE OF THE SUN, Christian Bale has continued to give one strong performance after another in a variety of period films (including HENRY V, NEWSIES and SWING KIDS). Even when the films have not been very good, his performances have been just fine. Bale plays Laurie as a character who is close to all of the March sisters in a series of relationships that even he does not fully understand. He brings some impressive emotion to the scenes where he explores these relationships, although his relationship with the older Amy probably should have been a little more fully explored. As the other key men in the lives of the March sisters, Gabriel Byrne and Eric Stoltz are not given much screen time but give decent performances (although Byrne's German accent takes a little getting used to). Even though Byrne is second billed in the film, he doesn't even appear until the last half hour and only has a few major scenes. Those scenes are pivotal to the story, though, and he and Ryder work well together. One particularly effective aspect of Swicord's script (and I assume this comes from Alcott's novel) is the respect and admiration that it shows for the art of writing. Jo's desire to write seems exceptionally genuine and the film does take the time to show some of the sense of liberation that can come from expressing your feelings on paper. The sequence in which Jo finally is inspired to truly write from her heart is one of the best staged depictions of the *act* of writing that I have seen on film. The cinematography and production design very effectively express the look of the period. The details seem very authentic and believable and the camerawork never gets in the way of the storytelling. Although many filmmakers tend to shoot this type of period drama in scope, the decision to shoot this one in a narrower format was a wise one. The intimate nature of the story might have been harmed by a wider format. I truly hope that this smart and very engaging drama manages to find the audience that it deserves. I worry that people will avoid the film on the basis of it being a ""children's movie"" or a ""woman's movie"". In truth, it is simply a good, smart drama with some teriffic performances. It is one of the best films of 1994. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

Little Women,Drama,2019,"The most enduring so-called ""girls' book"" ever written is Lousia May Alcott's 1868 LITTLE WOMEN, based in large part on her childhood experiences growing up in Concord, Massachusetts. The novel has previously been filmed five times, beginning with a 1918 silent version and including a British mini-series. It was even turned into a short- lived television series in 1979. The sixth filming may well rank as the most beautiful and compelling version, though certainly some will still prefer George Cukor's classic 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo March and Spring Byington as her mother. The newest version is directed by Australian Gillian Armstrong of MY BRILLIANT CAREER and MRS. SOFFEL. The Marches are a very tightly-knit family of four sisters and their ever-perfect mother. The family lives in 1860's Concord, Massachusetts. I have heard about families like this but never actually believed they existed. They share everything with each other and are bound to each other with a love that transcends even the rare imperfections. They do things like give up their Christmas morning dinner, including delicacies like sausage that are almost unavailable during the Civil War, to feed a hungry immigrant family. The girls read poetry, put on little plays written by Jo (played by Winona Ryder), and steal glances out their window at the boy next door, Laurie (Christian Bale), and his stodgy tutor (Eric Stoltz). The girls roll bandages and take care of the sick and hungry while waiting anxiously for letters from their father who is off fighting for the Union cause. The sisters do have their occasional differences, but they always give them up with a sigh of relief when something happens to bind them even closer together. Eventually Laurie becomes like one of the family and there is no doubt that he will eventually court one of the March girls. When he goes off to school the film jumps ahead four years and everyone but young Amy (Kirsten Dunst) looks just the same. Amy (now Samantha Mathis) looks like she has aged about eight years. Each daughter develops into the woman her childhood characteristics made her. Jo writes melodramatic potboilers and goes to New York (following her mothers suggestion, ""Embrace your liberty"") to make her fortune. And she becomes romantically entangled (big surprise!) with a German philosopher who shares the boarding house where she is staying. There is sad family tragedy, there is warm family love, and there are romantic entanglements. Remarkably, Armstrong makes this story of traditional values (with just a light whisper of feminism) work for a 90s audience, assisted by Geoffrey Simpson's nostalgic camera work. British Columbia stands in for Concord and makes everything look homey and beautiful. The casting of some of the major roles is a bit too Hollywood and not enough Alcott. Trini Alvarado looks more like a young Andie MacDowell than like Alcott's plumpish Meg. Alcott had Jo be tall and awkward, and even the film script calls for her to be plain and to have her long hair be her one nice feature. Does it sound like I am describing Winona Ryder? The casting of beauty in roles that call for plain tends to oversimplify the motivations of the various suitors. Claire Daines as Beth is the only daughter who approaches being homely- --in both senses of the word--in this version and the only one for whom we never see a suitor. Susan Sarandon conveys the warmth and wisdom of Alcott's overly-idealized mother. She is always there with just the right insight, with a nursing talent that puts doctors to shame, and with a noble and charitable thought for others. Kirsten Dunst seems far too precocious as the child Amy to grow into the placid Samantha Mathis adult version. Dunst does a good job, but she will be remembered more for her role as the adult vampire trapped in the body of a child from INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. Among other things, the film chronicles how Jo's childhood writing develops into what she writes as an adult. Here her imagination is seen as positive and constructive. But the timing of the release should invite interesting comparisons to Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. And LITTLE WOMEN sorely needs something for the viewer to think about when it is over rather than just being left with a warm feeling. I give LITTLE WOMEN a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

Little Women,Drama,2019,"LITTLE WOMEN is the story of four sisters and their mother. They have a father, but he remains pretty much a non-person through the entire show. The movie is set in Concord, Mass. in what appears to be somewhere between say 1800 and 1890. Eventually in the middle of the movie we are finally told that the show is firmly set in the 1860s because the missing and almost never mentioned father is off fighting a war. [And he probably thought they missed him a lot and appreciated he was risking his life to save his country!] Did I say the show had four sisters and their mother? I lied. It has four saints who are sisters, and who all live with their even more sainted mother. These five perfect females have a few males around them at times for decoration, but it is the women's show. The movie is populated with all of the latest heart throbs from Hollywood (Winona Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Kirsten Dunst, Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, and Eric Stoltz) and with Susan Sarandon in the Mother Teresa role. The acting is all incredibly shallow, but this is a fault of the script they were given. The characters are two dimensional stick figures. They do absolutely no wrong. If they had made them more believable and less sugary sweet, one could have cared about them when tragedy struck. As it was, I just felt like the script was being manipulative. Yes, maybe this is a problem with the book as well. Frankly, I do not remember the novel that well. Another smaller irritant was the role of the mother saint. It seemed like half of her dialog were sermons on the need for female equality. I had no problem with what she was saying, but it was delivered so preachy that it seemed stilted and unreal. I found myself wondering if the book gave this subject so much emphasis or if this was a little revisionist writing. On the good side, you have never seen more lovely scenes of New England snow (actually filmed in Victoria, Canada). Curier and Ives could not have done it better. The cinematography inside was equally stunning with wonderful warm candlelight glow yet bright enough to be able to see things well. Finally, I loved the last minute of the show. The outdoor images there were striking and almost moving. The movie runs way too long at 1:50. I lost track of how many times I looked at my watch wondering how much longer I had to sit there and endure it. It is rated PG but should have been G since there is no sex, nudity, violence or even a single gosh darn. The only reason for the PG rating is that some of the themes (sickness and death) are more mature. I do not recommend this show to anyone. Nevertheless, I suspect there is a large audience for this movie especially among girls from say 10 to 16. I give it * 1/2 strictly for the setting and the cinematography.

Little Women,Drama,2019,"Date Released: 12/21/94 (limited);12/25/94 (general) Running Length: 1:50 Rated: PG (Nothing offensive) Starring: Winona Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Samantha Mathis, Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, Gabriel Byrne, Eric Stoltz Director: Gillian Armstrong Producer: Denise Di Novi Screenplay: Robin Swicord based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott Cinematography: Geoffrey Simpson Music: Thomas Newman Released by Columbia Pictures ""I think the title [of LITTLE WOMEN] has been so off-putting for men over the generations. They feel this is a terribly 'girly' story. But it's actually a wonderful epic tale about family where men's roles are just as important and deeply involved in the story.... It is ... full of heartfelt emotion and such memorable characters whose lively appeal transcends the years."" - Gillian Armstrong, director of LITTLE WOMEN This third, and most recent, film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic 1868 novel about family and crossing the barrier between girlhood and womanhood, is a treatment for today's audiences. As faithful to the original story as a two-hour production is likely to be, LITTLE WOMEN is in ways similar and dissimilar to its two cinematic predecessors (released in 1933 and 1949). This tale of four independent sisters of differing temperaments is undeniably melodramatic, but it's very good melodrama, with an accumulation of vitality and charm that elevates the movie to an unexpectedly high level. The basic plot of LITTLE WOMEN isn't terribly original or invigorating; it's the effective realization of several memorable characters that gives this film its strength. For those not familiar with the novel, it centers around the March demesne of Orchard House in Concord, Mass. With her husband away fighting in the Civil War, Marmee (Susan Sarandon) is left alone to care for her four daughters: the volatile and imaginative Jo (Winona Ryder), the sophisticated Meg (Trini Alvarado), the compassionate Beth (Claire Danes), and the romantic Amy (Kirsten Dunst as a child and Samantha Mathis as an adult). The girls share a bond that no outsider can penetrate, although there are some willing to make the attempt--most of whom are men. There's Laurie (Christian Bale), a neighbor with a passion for the piano who becomes a friend to all the Marches; John Brooke (Eric Stoltz), a poor tutor who is smitten with Meg; and Professor Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne), a German immigrant who develops a friendship with Jo. With rich, colorful cinematography (the Autumn scenes are especially vibrant) and a fine score by Thomas Newman, LITTLE WOMEN is technically accomplished. It's the performances, however, that make this movie special. Winona Ryder fashions a near-perfect Jo, Alcott's headstrong alter-ego in the fictional autobiography. Had it been demanded of her, the actress undoubtedly could have carried the entire film. However, this version allows the other sisters some development independent of Jo, and all the actresses hold their own. The only hiccup comes as a result of the change in the aging Amy from the energetic and charismatic Kirsten Dunst to the more sedate Samantha Mathis. Christian Bale, after a couple of extremely weak performances (in NEWSIES and SWING KIDS), finally displays some recognizable talent. In fact, Bale is so solid as Laurie that it's hard to credit this actor as the same one who joined Robert Sean Leonard in the streets of Nazi Germany. Perhaps the greatest fault--and some may not see it as such--is that even the best-developed characters in LITTLE WOMEN display an alarming lack of character flaws. Everyone is almost always good, kind, sweet, and pleasant. Rare are the moments when someone says something nasty or does something unsavory. So much niceness occasionally makes LITTLE WOMEN seem too sugary and scripted. Nevertheless, the tale is engrossing enough, and the film put together with such obvious affection, that it's not hard to dismiss those things as necessary elements of a beloved period piece.

Little Women,Drama,2019,"Starring: Winona Ryder, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado, Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Samantha Mathis, Susan Sarandon. Screenplay: Robin Swicord. Director: Gillian Armstrong. It would be a tremendous disservice to think of LITTLE WOMEN as a picture post card with a plot. Sure, it is lovingly photographed, rich in atmosphere and steeped in period detail. But does Louisa May Alcott's saga of 19th century adolescence have anything to say in 1994? Is it really *about* anything? The answer is a resounding yes. It's about family, love, and the struggle of young women to find their voice. As brought to life by a magnificent cast and directed with restraint by Gillian Armstrong, LITTLE WOMEN is sweet, glorious and relevant. Set in Civil War-era Massachusetts, LITTLE WOMEN is the story of the March family: aspiring writer Jo (Winona Ryder); social Meg (Trini Alvarado); shy, frail Beth (Claire Danes); and romantic Amy (Kirsten Dunst, later Samantha Mathis). Living with their mother (Susan Sarandon) while their father is off fighting the war, the Marches struggle with matters financial and personal. Jo befriends a wealthy young man (Christian Bale), and Meg is courted by a teacher (Eric Stoltz). Eventually, Jo finds herself in New York to pursue her craft, where she meets Friedrick Baehr (Gabriel Byrne), a German scholar who sees potential in her that even she herself is unable to recognize. Director Armstrong, who addressed the subject of women struggling in a man's world in MY BRILLIANT CAREER, has done a splendid job with this latest version of the oft-filmed story. She never attempts to inject inappropriate action into the narrative, and keeps her actors quiet and naturalistic. She is also assisted by a wonderful technical crew. Cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson captures snow-covered landscapes and glowing fall colors with grace, and production designer Jan Roelfs fills the screen with lovely interiors. The crowning touch is Thomas Newman's beautiful score, which perfectly complements the beautiful images Armstrong provides. The primary reason the screen glows, however, is a remarkable cast which features the most talented young actresses in the business. Jo is the showcase role, and Winona Ryder gives her most complete performance yet in taking it on; she is full of ambition, joy, and self-doubt. Physically, she's quite wrong for the part (it's hard to believe anyone would consider Ryder's hair her ""one beauty,"" even without makeup), but she's so impressive emotionally that her looks can be forgiven. Trini Alvarado is an effervescent Meg, and Kirsten Dunst, fresh from her triumph in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, is the perfect image-conscious Amy. Claire Danes, from TV's critically-praised by largely unwatched ""My So-Called Life,"" may be the best of the bunch. Beth's role is small, but Danes injects phenomenal emotion into every one of her scenes, and her large, sad eyes guarantee that many eyes in the audience will be damp at certain moments. As a group (and including Susan Sarandon as the progressive matriarch), they are so uniformly good that they seem to keep making each other better. What may be most impressive about this LITTLE WOMEN, adapted by Robin Swicord, is how it seems as though it might have been written yesterday. There is no anachronism in Alcott's Transcendentalist proto-feminism, though upon first glance it might appear so. These little women struggle with all the issues involved in becoming grown women, from the mundane (Meg's concern about the dress she wears to a society function) to the profound (coping with the difficulties of love). Most of all, they struggle to assert themselves as individuals in a world which still questions their motives for wanting to be individuals. Jo is frustrated in her first attempts at publishing her work because she is attempting to something and someone else; her realization that her own experience is valid, and that she can touch others through its expression, is a revelation. I saw LITTLE WOMEN in a theater where perhaps one third of the audience consisted of girls under sixteen. LITTLE WOMEN may be a story to which they are most attuned, but it is a delight for anyone who appreciates genuine emotion, insight, and beautiful filmmaking.

Little Women,Drama,2019,"No, this movie doesn't feature the many girlfriends in the life of Tattoo from ""Fantasy Island"" (located two miles east of Gilligan's Island), it's an adaptation of the classic Louisa May-Alcott novel about the Civil War days... and a darn good one at that. I wasn't too thrilled about two hours of repressed women in bustles, but once I gave in to my feminine side (I know you're snickering right now, so just stop it), I got into it. Fueled by excellent performances from Winona Ryder (the movie was almost retitled SLAVERY BITES), Claire Danes (star of the defunct drama ""My So-Called Life""), Kristen Dunst (who gets my vote of approval just for saying kissing greasy Brad Pitt in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE was ""yucky"") and Susan Sarandon (obviously, she plays the mother), LITTLE WOMEN is thoroughly entertaining without the usual 90's Hollywood hang-ups of sex, violence and profanity. Well, someone does say ""blast it!"" (gasp!) in LITTLE WOMEN, but otherwise, it's profanity-free. If you were ever forced to read the book in school, you're already familiar with the dainty-yet-tough-as-nails ladies in the March family, who are making it on their own in the absence of the father, who is off fighting the war. The main character, Jo, wants to be a writer (let's not draw any parallels here), while the other sisters just want to find husbands (women never change). We see two hours of their trials and tribulations, with moments of tense drama and female bonding. It's a good movie, but even though I tried to block the flow of testosterone to my brain for two hours, I was still bored and restless at times. It took me no less than six sittings to get through LITTLE WOMEN, so a word of warning to you non-movie-reviewing guys--this movie is not to be entered into lightly. Male minds require great persistance to finish LITTLE WOMEN, which is one of the ultimate chick flicks out there, but once you get through, you can list it on your resume for the rest of your life.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Rated on a 4-star scale Screening venue: Odeon (Liverpool City Centre) Released in the UK by Buena Vista International on April 7, 2000; certificate 15; 145 minutes; country of origin USA; aspect ratio 1.85:1 Directed by Norman Jewison; produced by Armyan Bernstein, Norman Jewison, John Ketcham. Written by Armyan Bernstein, Dan Gordon; based on the books ""The 16th Round"" by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter and ""Lazarus and the Hurricane"" by Sam Chaiton, Terry Swinton. Photographed by Roger Deakins; edited by Stephen Rivkin. We all have talents that mystify other people -- some folks can work complex equations in their heads, others can run for miles without getting short of breath, and we all know some show-off who can cartwheel like there's no tomorrow. I can't do any of that stuff, but I do know Bob Dylan's eight-minute ballad ""Hurricane"" off by heart. Impressive, eh? The song is the first track on Dylan's 1975 album ""Desire"", and tells the story of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, a black middleweight boxer from New Jersey who angered intolerant locals with his cocky handling of success. In 1966, when the authorities saw a chance to frame him for murder, they jumped at it. ""How can the life of such a man be in the palm of some fool's hand?"" Dylan asked, and for quite some time Ellen Burstyn, Muhammad Ali and a whole host of other celebrities and activists were equally concerned. Despite his status as a cause célèbre, though, it took twenty years for Carter and his co-defendant to be released from prison. When they were, according to Norman Jewison's film ""The Hurricane"", it was largely due to the efforts of a commune of Canadians and a young boy they were schooling. The kid, Lesra Martin (Viscellous Reon Shannon), had bought Carter's autobiography for twenty-five cents at a used book sale. This event changed the course of both his life and that of the fighter. Carter (Denzel Washington), as Lesra discovers from his reading and we learn in the film, had an upbringing heavily influenced by racial persecution, and vowed to make weapons out of his body and mind. In prison, his shell grows harder, and he becomes a vessel of mistrust and hate. ""There's no more Rubin Carter,"" he says in his book. To his wife: ""I'm dead. Move on. Bury me."" Somehow Lesra is able to strike up a correspondence with him; he DOES feel alive when he's writing, because he doesn't have to look at the dehumanising prison walls. The communication develops into friendship and love, and results in the boy and his surrogate family dedicating their lives to Carter's appeal. One of the most involving things about ""The Hurricane"" is how it demonstrates the power of the written word -- showing that it can free souls, stimulate emotions and overcome violence and evil. Another is its portrayal of how Rubin, who had so thoroughly trained himself to use hatred as a means of survival, earned liberation by having the courage to feel love and trust. This is fantastic material -- the kind of thing we're talking about when we refer to ""triumphs of the human spirit"". It's regrettable that Jewison has not presented it with more panache. Gone is the powerful staccato rhythm of Dylan, and instead we get such ludicrous dialogue as ""You're going down, punk!"" and ""Jeez... you're having a smoke for breakfast?"" There are tears, speeches behind bars and far too much sentimental scoring. Dan Hedaya gives a ludicrous performance as a corrupt cop who lurks in corners grimacing and growling. The movie is made with such lack of edge that at times it runs the risk of alienating us, like a made-for-TV weepie. But the story somehow survives, and remains potent, and that is a testament to how great a tale it is. Just as 'Hurricane' himself championed over oppressive forces, so too does his legend transcend a sloppy telling, and remain one worth knowing.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Directed by: Norman Jewison Written by: Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, Sam Chaiton In the past I have stated that strong performances are incapable of saving an otherwise weak film (1998's Hurlyburly being a perfect example of this). Denzel Washington proves me wrong in ""The Hurricane"", the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter. While the film itself is languid, overlong, and melodramatic, Washington's performance is outstanding. Washington has, in fact, already received a Golden Globe nomination for his role, and if he doesn't receive an Oscar nomination to go along with this, someone in the academy is going to hang. Shot in two different time periods, the film tells the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Denzel Washington). Portions of the film show Rubin's rise to fame and troubles with the authorities. The time frame then shifts to Rubin's days in prison and the efforts of a young man named Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) and his three Canadian teachers/foster parents (John Hannah, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Unger) to free him. While the group searches for clues which will help exonerate Carter, they are threatened and harassed by the racist cop (Dan Hedaya) who pinned the murder on Rubin thirty years prior. The majority of the film moves along at such a leisurely pace that I noticed half of the audience drifting off. During these scenes, all one can do is wait for Washington to show up and ignite the screen. However, not all of the film is quite so sluggish. The scenes in which the Canadians hunt for clues move along at a nice, brisk pace. The biggest fault perhaps lies in the amount of time spent on Carter's younger days. For nearly half of the very long picture, we watch Carter get cheated out of everything he's earned again and again. During these scenes, we're shown Hedaya's vengeful Lieutenant Della Pesce trying everything he can to have Carter locked up. The problem here is that despite a great job by Hedaya (as always), the character has no personality. He's evil, pure and simple. We're given nothing beyond this. In a movie like ""Star Wars"" this works fine, but here we really need something more to make us hate this character. As for the performances here, I've already made clear how incredible Washington is, but the majority of the supporting cast is really quite good as well. I truly believe that Dan Hedaya can't help but act well. Liev Schrieber (Scream 2), Deborah Unger (The Game), and John Hannah (The Mummy) are all adequate at their worst and entertaining at their best. Clancy Brown (Highlander) and Rod Steiger (End of Days) both make fairly brief appearances, but both are talented enough actors that it's a pleasure seeing them at all. The only weak link here is Vicellous Reon Shannon. I'm not entirely sure if this is due to Shannon himself, or the rather weak dialogue written for him. I lean towards the latter because every now and then Shannon seems to break free and display some real talent. ""The Hurricane"" is by no means a great movie. It can, however, be an interesting one at times. The film runs 125 minutes, which would normally be a good running time, but fifteen minutes or so of this movie could easily have been chopped. ""The Hurricane"" is at its best when we see how Carter deals with life in prison, which involves him cutting himself off from anything and anyone he cared about. However, countless melodramatic scenes and a whole lot of preaching keep the film from being anything more than fairly good. I'd recommend waiting for video on this one, but do try and see it.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"THE HURRICANE (M). (Warner Bros/Beacon/Village Roadshow) Director: Norman Jewison Stars: Denzel Washington, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Vicellous Reon Shannaon, Dan Hedaya, David paymer, Harris Yulin, Rod Steiger, Clancy Brown, Al Waxman, David Lansbury, Garland Whitt, Badja Djola Running time: 156 minutes. Here comes the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, the boxer who was framed for a murder he didn't commit and spent the next 22 years fighting to prove his innocence. Carter's story was first made famous through Bob Dylan's song, which resonates throughout the film, but The Hurricane continues the story up to the present day. Writers Dan Gordon and Armyan Bernstein take numerous liberties with the truth, changing many of the facts for dramatic purposes. In the process, The Hurricane becomes a powerful howl of outrage against the volatile climate of racial tension and intolerance that led to a blatant miscarriage of justice. Director Norman Jewison has explored these themes before, most notably in the Oscar winning classic In The Heat Of The Night and A Soldier's Story, and his obvious passion shapes this epic film into an overtly manipulative yet compelling and moving experience. The fight to clear his name is taken up in earnest when the barely literate 13 year old Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon, a regular on tv series Dangerous Minds, etc) purchases a copy of Carter's autobiography for 25 cents at a book sale. Lesra has been taken under the wing of three liberal Canadians (Liev Schreiber, Deborah Kara Unger, from Crash, etc, and Sliding Doors' John Hannah), who take him from the slums of Brooklyn to improve his education. Inspired by Carter's book, Lesra begins a correspondence with the imprisoned boxer that changes both their lives. Embittered and disillusioned by his experience, Carter (superbly played by Denzel Washington in one of the best performances of his career) begins to trust the young Lesra, and an unlikely but ultimately inspiring friendship develops. Convinced by Lesra's belief in Carter's innocence, his three guardians begin to investigate the case themselves, hoping to find the crucial evidence that will overturn the wrongful conviction. They are dealing with a case in which the tainted evidence is firmly buried in the past. Many key witnesses are long dead, and some of the remaining players, like corrupt racist cop Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya), want to ensure it remains closed. Eventually the three amateur sleuths triumph, as Federal Court Judge Sarokin (Rod Steiger) overturns the conviction and sets Carter free. Unlike other more conventional biopics about champion boxers (Somebody Up There Likes Me, The Greatest, and Martin Scorsese's blistering Raging Bull, etc) The Hurricane is as much as a powerful prison drama, with overtones of The Shawshank Redemption, and a stirring quest for justice as it is the story of a fighter who could have been the champion of the world. Jewison has taken a leaf out of Scorsese's book, and had veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins film the brutal boxing scenes in glorious black and white. But The Hurricane is not merely the story of Carter's search for justice and redemption - it is also Lesra's story. Jewison draws wonderful parallels between the pair - one imprisoned by racial hatred and prejudice and searching for justice, the other largely imprisoned by the impoverishment of his background and struggling for direction. However, some of the peripheral characters, such as Hedaya's corrupt cop and the three Canadians, are clumsily sketched and remain largely stereotyped and ill-defined The stellar cast struggle against an often impoverished script to bring their underdeveloped characters to life. Fittingly enough, The Hurricane is Washington's film, and his powerful presence dominates the screen. He brings an innate sense of dignity to every role he plays, but here he also brings a palpable sense of anger and vehemence to his powerful performance. Washington is thoroughly convincing in a complex role that requires him to age some 20 years and run a gamut of emotions. Steiger's brief appearance as the judge is certainly flamboyant, but, thankfully, less erratic than his recent scene stealing turn in a similar role in the recent Crazy In Alabama. With The Hurricane, Jewison wears his heart openly on his sleeve, which leads to some moments that are manipulative, clichéd and saccharine. However, it's a measure of Jewison's earnest and impassioned approach that Carter can utter a line as potentially clichéd as ""Hate put me in this prison, but love is going to set me free"" and reduce an audience to tears rather than howls of derision.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Directed by Norman Jewison. Screenplay by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, based on the books ""The Sixteenth Round"" by Rubin Carter and ""Lazarus and the Hurricane"" by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton. Starring Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya. Running time: 146 minutes. Rated AA for controversial subject matter and offensive language. Reviewed on February 23rd, 2000. ""The Hurricane"" is the story of boxer Rubin Carter (Denzel Washington), a middleweight boxing champion who in 1966 was convicted of three murders, on the basis of a case steeped in racial prejudice. During Carter's stay in prison, his plight drew the attention of ""the famous and the infamous"", including celebrities such as Bob Dylan and Muhammed Ali. Despite this, Carter remained imprisoned until 1985, when a teenager named Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) -- inspired by Carter's autobiography ""The Sixteenth Round"" -- took up his cause. ""The Hurricane"" has many things going for it. In particular, there is Washington's performance as Hurricane Carter, which has won him a Golden Globe award and an Emmy nomination. Washington practically disappears into the character, suffusing Carter with nobility, passion and determination. This is not an easy role to play: Washington's challenge is to portray Carter as intense without turning him into a fanatic. He succeeds, with a performance broad enough to permit Carter not just great strength but also moments of weakness, especially as Lesra's efforts start to bear fruit. ""I'm fifty years old,"" Carter laments to his lawyers at one point. He has been in prison more than half his life, and we feel the weight of every one of those years. The defining moment of Washington's performance comes when, at the start of his life sentence, Carter refuses to wear a prison uniform because he will not wear the clothes of a guilty man. He is sent into solitary confinement for ninety days to reconsider his protest. In many ways, he never emerges: to cope with his imprisonment, Carter isolates himself from the rest of the world. He focuses on honing his mind and body, and congregates more with his own inner demons than with his fellow inmates. The scenes of Carter in jail are ""The Hurricane's"" most powerful, but in a sense are really just a backdrop for one of the movie's main themes, about redemption through the written word. This is made clear from the start: an early scene sees an uncharacteristically desperate Carter pleading with a friendly prison guard (Clancy Brown) that his cell not be searched, for fear of having his partly-completed autobiography taken. It is by writing his story, and by reading voraciously, that Carter survives the prison experience. ""The Sixteenth Round"" becomes the first book the barely-literate Lesra ever buys, and through it he discovers Hurricane Carter's plight. Carter and Lesra spend much of the movie communicating not by phone but by letters. And by the end, this odyssey of paper and ink has benefited both their lives. Performances from the rest of the cast are respectable but not as well-rounded. This is not entirely surprising; ""The Hurricane"" is Carter's story, after all, and he deserves the spotlight. But the lack of development of the supporting cast is disappointing, particularly in the case of Lesra, a young man from a broken home whose encounters with Carter help him realize his own potential. Shannon's acting is capable, but the growth of his character is conveyed more by what we are told than what we are shown, transgressing a fundamental rule of storytelling. Given rather less to do are Lesra's guardians (Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah). They act virtually as a gestalt, often referred to simply (and irritatingly) as ""the Canadians"". We never really get a firm idea of why they do what they do -- why they are together, why they are taking care of Lesra, why they do so much to help Carter (even moving to New Jersey from Ontario!) -- and it seems little effort was expended in making them anything more than plot facilitators. I was nine years old when Rubin Carter was released from prison and have no recollection of the events surrounding his eventual freedom, so I can offer little comment as to the historical accuracy of ""The Hurricane"". Indeed, I don't think a film need be bound by the letter of the truth, if a certain amount of license will make it better artistically. But I have to wonder if the wholesale invention of Detective Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) does ""The Hurricane"" service from either a factual or an aesthetic point of view. In the movie, Della Pesca is the man mainly responsible for setting up Hurricane Carter, a deed which is the culmination of a lifelong grudge against the boxer. In reality, he never existed. He is intended, I suppose, to be a synthesis of all those who helped put Carter away, but Della Pesca himself is so crucial to ""The Hurricane"" that it is difficult to imagine how things 'really' happened. Moreover, he is almost embarrassingly one-dimensional, given no more characterization beyond his vaguely-motivated hatred for Carter. It almost feels as though Della Pesca should have worn a black hat and a Snidely Whiplash-style moustache. Indeed, the movie's biggest problem is that the story itself ends up feeling excessively Hollywood-ized. Nowhere is this more true than in the climactic courtroom scenes, which -- true to reality or not -- feel like a disappointing cop-out after two hours of Washington's enthralling characterization. There were many issues ""The Hurricane"" could have dealt with more fully: the maturation of Lesra, the way an entire justice system can be blinded by prejudice, even the question of whether Carter really might have committed the crimes (the movie doesn't even raise the possibility). Instead of challenging us, the film settles for a routine trial scene surprisingly lacking in dramatic value, as if director Norman Jewison knew the ending was uninspired. We already know how the movie is going to end, so emphasizing the court proceedings is unnecessary. It is a shame that so gripping a performance as Washington's winds up being subordinate to a cliche. ""The Hurricane"" would have been better served by keeping its focus on the characters and their personal journeys, instead of the events through which they traveled.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's film reviews every Friday morning on the 98.9 The Point morning show.--- A copy of this review can be found at http://www.moviereviews.org/the_hurricane.htm First he wrote a book about it. Then Bob Dylan wrote a critically acclaimed song about it. Now Academy Award winning director Norman Jewison and Academy Award winning actor Denzel Washington have a made a movie about it. The man is Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and the story is one of such power that it puts the knock-out punches he delivered as a prize fighter to shame. ""Here comes the story of the hurricane."" (Did you really think I would make it through this review without quoting Bob Dylan?) Rubin Carter (Denzel Washington) was the champion of the world, having lost but a handful of fights and delivering forceful flurries of punches that would floor his opponents. But he was also black, something that didn't stand well in the eyes of a certain police officer (Dan Hedaya). When two black men wreak murderous havoc on a bar one night in the 1960's, Hurricane and another man soon find themselves in prison for a crime they didn't commit. The film ventures away from the other man and focuses on Hurricane; his way of coping with prison (""innocence is highly overrated commodity""); his refusal to give in (""I've committed no crime. A crime has been committed against me"") and his eventually giving up (""I'm dead. Just bury me please""). Then, when hope was all but lost, a young and once underprivileged black boy, being raised and schooled by an upper-middle class Canadian family, stumbled upon the aforementioned autobiography. With the help of his new Canadian family, Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) looks to free the champion of the world in the biggest fight Hurricane will ever step into . The Hurricane spends little time on Rubin Carter's childhood and instead focuses intensely on the very interesting time he spent in the boxing ring, in prison and in court. Boxing brings enjoyable sporting moments, while prison offers deep intellectual insights and court provides (SPOLER!!!) a heartbreak early-on and a sure-to-make-you-smile moment at the film's end. Most of the film is spent in prison, however. Recently, The Green Mile painted a particularly rosy and black and white view of jail with extraordinarily kind guards and inmates minus the few rotten apples who are 100% rotten. Here things are more complex: some guards are nice, some are cruel and one particularly kind inmate professes wicked ways. But Hurricane isolates himself from the beginning when he gets 90 days in the hole for refusing to wear prison-issued garments. Denzel Washington gives yet another kick-ass performance in a year when many great acting jobs will unfortunately lack recognition due to high quantity. The supporting cast also comes up strong with Dan Hedaya as a bigoted police officer and youngster Vicellous Reon Shannon as a curiosity driven, justice seeking boy in the champ's corner. Simply put, The Hurricane is a knock-out punch. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"For more reviews and movie screensavers, visit http://www.joblo.com/ Denzel Washington has never been afraid to play the part of a man who triumphs in the face of adversity, and this true life tale of Rubin Carter, a man who was wrongly imprisoned for over 19 years, sure fits that bill to the tee. Washington shines in another great role which actually has you feeling some of the pain and anguish of a man, whose unimaginable ordeal could only make one wonder about the absurdity of our own everyday insignificant complaints. PLOT: Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, a champion boxer, is wrongly convicted of a murder and spends close to twenty years in prison. Appeal after appeal, march after march and outcry after outcry does not set this man free, until the day that a young black man picks up his book at a fair, and along with his three Canadian friends, attempt to free the man who has been unjustly placed behind bars for the better half of his life. CRITIQUE: A powerful, moving and emotional drama ready to replenish you with spirit and determination in the face of adversity, while demonstrating once again, the superior acting talents of a man who goes by the name of Denzel Washington. In fact, his cohort in this film, Vicellous Reon Shannon, also swings the bat for a homer in his first major role, as the duo combine to draw some believable faces onto a story which is just too unbelievable to imagine. Don't get me wrong, despite it being a true-to-life story, it is all too sad to have to admit that I had heard plenty of similar tales beforehand, but thankfully for us all, the magical touch of Denzel Washington just made this film invigorating and inspiring to behold. And yes, I hope to God the Academy tips their hat to this wonderful actor once again this time around. He plays him cocky, he plays him blissful, he plays him violent, he plays him soft-spoken, in fact, he plays the man through many of the colors that he explored throughout his lifetime. The story, a classic, is one of triumph over adversity, persistence over resignation, love over hate, and ultimately, one of justice over injustice, but truly it speaks of the power of the human spirit. Would any one of us have been able to survive the terrible ordeal that this man had to endure for all those years? Everything taken away from him. His life, his job, his kids, his wife, his dignity, his everything! And what do you say about those four people who decided to dedicate their entire lives to getting this man out of prison? A man who they barely knew! Yes, even the ""Hurricane"" himself said that he would not have been able to do that for another. Actually, that was the one part of the story which I wished they had explored further. Those Canadians. What was their story? Who were they really? The film barely speaks of them in detailed terms and skates around the issue of their actual professions, and even their ultimate intentions to do the things that they did. Don't get me wrong, they are admirable without a doubt, but I would have liked to have known more about them (The Little Known Facts below might shed a little light on that, JoBlo :). The film was also a little slow at parts, but I think the pacing was done purposely in order for us to better appreciate the snail-like grind of this man's solitary experience. All in all, the secondary actors all could have been snapped up a notch or two, but none of that really mattered much with the knockout performance from Denzel as Rubin. Rarely does a film transcend the level of a good film and become one with greater connotations simply because of its lead performance, but THE HURRICANE is just that. Now give that man an Oscar, dammit! Little Known Facts about this film and its stars: A recent interview with the real Rubin Carter and Lesra Martin on the Oprah Winfrey show confirmed a couple of greater coincidences in their life stories which were not accurately depicted in the film. 1. For one, the first letter which Lesra wrote to Rubin in jail, was actually just one letter amongst the hundreds of messages that Hurricane would receive in jail. In fact, he never wrote back to any of them, but for some strange and inexplicable reason, he found himself spiritually attracted to that one letter in the pack. He opened it, read it and was deeply touched by it. As per the film, Rubin finally sat down at his typewriter and wrote Lesra back a thank-you letter. The rest...is history. 2. A similar experience overcame Lesra when he first spotted Rubin's book at the Toronto book fair. In fact, he felt as though the cover of the book itself ""spoke to him"", and actually spent around two hours following the man who was holding the book at the fair, until he finally dropped it and Lesra made it his own purchase. To clear up the ""Canadians question"", it turns out that in the actual story, there were nine Canadians who lived and worked together on the Carter case. However, for the sake of developing well-rounded and believable characters with whom the audience could relate, the nine became three. Those folks were basically the three who actually went to New Jersey and did most of the legwork on the case. This film is based on two books. The first was written by the man on whom the entire film is based, Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, and his book called ""The 16th Round"", and the other was written by two men, Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton, whose novel is entitled ""Lazarus and the Hurricane"". In fact, the film's original title was LAZARUS AND THE HURRICANE. To prepare for his role as boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, Denzel Washington apparently worked out for a year with trainer Terry Claybon and lost a total of 44 pounds.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Year: 1999. Starring Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Dan Hedaya, Debbi Morgan, Clancy Brown, David Paymer, Harris Yulin, Rod Steiger. Screenplay by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon. Directed by Norman Jewison. Rated R. There are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort. Often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile. When one of these comes along, I usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie, that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders. But sometimes there is simply no other explanation, and such is the case with ""The Hurricane."" This biopic about falsely convicted boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter would normally be called ""Norman Jewison's 'The Hurricane,'"" as per the tradition of referring to a film ""belonging"" to a director. But though he does decent work, Jewison cannot claim ownership of ""The Hurricane,"" because there is one reason this film works at all, and his name is Denzel Washington. Washington plays Carter, a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar. Jailed for 20 years, he maintained that he had never committed the crimes, but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals. The situation changed when a group of Canadians moved to Washington and worked on freeing Carter. Through the efforts of that group and Carter's lawyers, he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that Rubin Carter had been unfairly convicted. The film details Carter's childhood, which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop (Dan Hedaya). When he finally got out of prison for good, Carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer, seemingly having his career on track, until the police framed him for multiple homicide. Despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities, he remained imprisoned. Flash forward to 1983, when Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) a young African-American boy, living with a group of Canadian tutors, reads the book Carter wrote while in prison. The book, entitled ""The Sixteenth Round,"" opens young Lesra's eyes to the injustice that was Carter's life, and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer. Lesra convinces his Canadian friends (Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah) to work with him towards his goal. ""The Hurricane"" leans on Denzel Washington. He must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will, and he does so brilliantly. It's probably accurate to say that Washington does not embody Rubin Carter, because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that Washington embodies the character of Rubin Carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film. The actor's work is masterful; Washington throws himself into every moment, refusing to keep the audience at arm's length. We feel everything he feels: the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life, the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight, and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost. Washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth. He doesn't merely play angry, happy, or sad; he feels it at the deepest level. His work is masterful, and for half of this film I realized that the scene I was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor. Norman Jewison directs the film, doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection. ""The Hurricane"" moves quickly, with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely. Jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is, and nothing is terribly confusing. His boxing scenes, constructed with clear inspiration from ""Raging Bull,"" get inside the action very well, and they are believable as real sports footage. Jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick: Carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform, and Jewison, assisted by some wonderful acting from a game Washington, shows how Carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude, and eventually we get three Rubin Carters arguing with each other in one cell. Jewison's best achievement in ""The Hurricane"" is succeeding at showing how Carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life, and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again. Sadly, though, the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay, as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter. There is much to interest a viewer in ""The Hurricane,"" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clichéd route possible, it does. Take a look at the supporting characters, for example, who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil. Carter and Lesra (played nicely by Shannon, who deserves credit) are the only real people here; everyone else is a stereotype. The Canadians are good. The cops are bad. The Canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune (and it is a commune, despite the film's failure to make that clear), while every racist cop (especially Dan Hedaya's) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room. Much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey (""Hate put me in prison. Love's gonna bust me out.""), and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-TV Lifetime special. It's too bad. The cast is game, the director does his job, and the subject matter is interesting, but the script takes the safer, slightly more boring route far too often. I wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against Carter other than ""he's a racist pig."" I wanted more evidence that these Canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice. In short, I wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens. Criticism has been levied against the liberties ""The Hurricane"" takes with the truth of what really happened to Carter, and much of it is deserved. For example, the film gives us a boxing scene showing Carter pummeling defending champ Joey Giardello, only to be screwed by the judges, who ruled Giardello the winner. Most accounts of the fight, however, have Carter losing fairly. Furthermore, much of Carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film, and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained. Of course, ""The Hurricane"" works mainly as a fable, so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially, but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact: ""The Hurricane"" is a highly flawed film. Only one actor could have made a schmaltzy, predictable picture like this work as well as it does, and it's a good thing ""The Hurricane"" has that actor. Carter has been quoted as saying, ""Denzel Washington is making me look good,"" but he's not the only one. Washington makes this film look good. Denzel Washington's ""The Hurricane."" Sounds pretty good to me.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"THE HURRICANE (1999) *** Directed by Norman Jewison; written by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, based on ""The 16th Round"" (1974) autobiography by Hurricane Carter, and on ""Lazarus and the Hurricane"" (1991) by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton. Photography, Roger Philip Rosenberg. Music, Christopher Young. Produced by Bernstein, John Ketcham and Jewison. Cast: Denzel Washington (Rubin Carter), John Hannah (Terry), Deborah Kara Unger (Lisa), Liev Schreiber (Sam), Vicellous Reon Shannon (Lesra), David Paymer (Myron Beldock), Dan Hedaya (Della Pesca), Harris Yulin (Leon Friedman), Garland Whitt (John Artis), Rod Steiger (Federal Judge Sarokin). A Universal release. 146 minutes. R (physical and psychological violence) Several sources list this movie as 125 minutes long. The theater I saw it in says 146, as does the site of its chain. I had intended to use my chronometer, but I was engrossed enough to forget doing this. I am also somewhat baffled by the hullabaloo raised by ""The Hurricane,"" about historical inexactitudes and omissions. The movie falls in the genre of biopics. There's no more fanciful type than this, barring total fantasies like Hercules fighting the Incas. Biopics are notoriously manipulated, falsified, misleading and wrong. Think of films from great (even prize-winning) to junky, about figures ranging from Attila to Zola Napoleon, Zapata, Pasteur, Hitler, Lawrence of Arabia, Lord Nelson, Ferdinand de Lesseps, Queen Victoria, Buffalo Bill, Juarez, Mata Hari, Al Capone, Bonnie and Clyde, Hemingway and so on... In fact, even with the best, most scholarly and historical intentions, the most faithful stories of a life have to have cuts, simplifications, amalgamations or condensations when they are turned into films. The fact remains that the story of boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter has been made into a very good, very moving, very well-acted, very well-produced movie. It follows the life of a black boy who is sent to reformatory for pulling a knife on a white, influential local who is a child molester. The kid spends years in that prison, eventually escapes, joins the Army, becomes its lightweight champion abroad, returns home, becomes a middleweight contender. Two men enter a New Jersey bar and gun down three people (white). Carter, then 29 is arrested along with his 21-year old admirer John Artis (black). They are falsely accused and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. They spent 19 years in prison. Claiming his innocence, Carter set to prove it from his cell. As played by the extraordinary Denzel Washington, he is a mixture of fascinating personalities that complement one another: the rebel, the good convict, the man in despair, the man who educates himself, the writer of his autobiography ""The 16th Round"" published in 1974 while he was still in jail. It is this book that comes to the attention of Lesra, a 15-year old African-American boy whom some Canadian activists and commune-dwellers in Toronto had rescued from a bad family environment and ""adopted"" so as to prepare him for high school. Lesra's fascination for Rubin Carter communicates to his hosts. These are Sam, Terry and Lisa, the prettiest chain-smoker in film history. They dedicate themselves to proving Rubin innocent, and eventually succeed. The film has superior photography, and acting by Washington and by Vicellous Reon Shannon (Lesra) who is already an experienced actor and who is in reality far older than what he seems to be. The choice of music is one of the best, including the song ""Hurricane"" by Bob Dylan. Dylan was one of the defenders of Rubin's, along with many other champions, celebrities and non-celebrities, but it would seem that it was only the Canadian friends who showed enough staying power to finish the job. ""The Hurricane"" is a grab-your-heartstrings, moving motion picture, even a two-handkerchief work. Its director, Norman Jewison, is a Canadian and an old ""liberal"" (a nice word that has been made into a pox by the Right). His credits include themes of discrimination, ""A Soldier's Story"" (about a black army officer) and ""In the Heat of the Night""(about a black Philadelphia policeman in the South). He knows his subject. ""The Hurricane"" is not without some inventions (over and above the omissions), such as a vengeful cop who is Rubin's nemesis the way Inspector Javert was to Jean Valjean in ""Les Miserables."" I will not detail them. They are for a good cause. They are also counterbalanced by some discreet touches, e.g. a prison guard who likes Carter, probably believes him, yet shows it silently simply through photographic angles and close-ups. I disregard, or at least don't get hot under the collar for, several of the objections to the movie's historicity. But one aspect annoyed me: the fact that the three Canadians were unexplored characters. In reality there were several more people in the commune, here reduced to just three, the pro-Rubin activists. But eliminating the others leads to confusion. Are Terry, Lisa and Sam a menage a trois? Can one call three cohabitants a commune? What exactly did the micro-commune do besides taking in Lesra and fighting for Rubin? (We are not told, either, that eventually Lisa and Rubin married, then divorced --but that could be justified as a personal fact that comes after Carter's liberation). Lacunae, some distortions and all, the film is valid, involving and anti-racist.. Its flaws of omission and commission are characteristic of the arguments of true believers in causes, of political movements, of schools of thought, where the activists draw blanket conclusions. Imperfect, but a fact of life.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"The Hurricane (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Denzel Washington, Dan Hayeda and Vicellas Reon Shannon. Directed by Norman Jewison. Norman Jewison's ""The Hurricane"" is like a powerful force of nature, unbridled and undisciplined. This true story of boxer Rubin `Hurricane' Carter features an intense performance by Denzel Washington, which should garner him an Academy Award best actor nomination. But Jewison's staging of the film is akin an undisciplined young boxer. He's a flailer instead of a fighter, always looking for the knock-out punch and forgetting to jab and feint. It is Washington's bridled and disciplined portrayal of Carter that carries this movie. Playing a man who turns his rage and disappointment inward, he refuses to be beaten by the system. Inside he may suffer, but outwardly he remains proud and defiant. He refuses to wear a prison uniform saying that he `won't wear the clothes of a guilty man.' His body may be incarcerated by the state, but his mind and soul remain free. For the uninitiated Carter was a championship boxer who in 1966 was railroaded to prison for the murder of two men and a woman at a bar in Paterson, N.J. He served more than 20 years before his conviction was overturned by a federal judge and he was released.. To simplify the plot - and the film - Jewison has created a villain, a racist detective played by Dan Hayeda who seems to have had it out for Carter since he was a kid. Unfortunately, this weakens the movie by allowing society and the prevailing judicial system of that era off the hook and transforming the racism Carter faced into a personal one-on-one vendetta. And director Jewison shows no subtlety in his depiction of Hayeda's Detective Della Pesca. His racism, his hatred is so apparent, so overblown that he nearly becomes a cartoonish caricature. Yet by force of his acting skill Washington transcends the script's and Jewison's flaws. The movie crackles when he is on screen, ""The Hurricane"" is two stories. The second concerns a disenfranchised black youth who lives with a group of three white Canadians in Toronto. The teen-ager, Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon). finds a copy of Carter's autobiography at a book sale, buys it, reads it and is inspired by it. He writes Carter and a friendship develops. He helps the bitter boxer by offering hope as he enlists his three activist guardians to help battle for Carter's freedom. The script takes liberties with the facts in the case, trimming the number of people who fought for Carter's release. Yet it still remains a powerful document, Young Shannon gives a fine performance as the idealistic, hero-worshipping Lesra, who with the help of his guardians has raised himself from his street-ghetto environment. But this is Washington's movie from start to finish. He doesn't just play Rubin Carter, he becomes him in walk and talk. It is the actor's strongest performance to date in a stellar career that already has included some outstanding work - ""Glory,"" ""Philadelphia"" and ""A Soldier's Story,"" to name a few. ""The Hurricane"" has its shortcomings, but the performances and subject matter compensate for its inadequacies. Bob Bloom is the film critic at the Journal and Courier in Lafayette, IN.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Cast: Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Deborah Unger, Leiv Schreiber, John Hannah and Dan Hedaya Director: Norman Jewison Producer(s): Armyan Berstein, Norman Jewison, and John Ketcham As an up and coming boxer, Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, had a lot of things going for him and it looked like things in his life were on the up and up until he was wrongfully imprisoned for murder. Ending up spending many years in jail, trying in vain to get his sentence and wrongful conviction overturned. This movie is the story of his life. The movie is based on a true story about a real man and is quite touching and surprisingly doesn't deviate from the truth other than for some artistic leeway (a Hollywood first). There is some great acting in this movie especially on the part of Denzel Washington, he manages to capture the role of Rubin Carter perfectly and makes the movie magical. He manages to portray the real person as well as the character that is in the script he is given admirably. Aside from Denzel Washington the remainder of the cast portray their roles very well and bring out the warm characters that are involved in this story as well as some of the truly harsh and evil ones. The casting for the roles in this movie is great everyone fit their role perfectly; the movie is an example of what casting for a movie should be like. The whole cast gives the movie a very real quality that it needed to have in order to be credible. Now, this movie is quite long being just under three hours so that's my warning to anyone who can't sit for that long. Regardless of length the pacing in the movie keeps you interested the whole time (and we'll ignore the one guy who was happily sleeping when the movie ended). The pace was perfect I didn't want to get up to stretch my legs even and that is rare for a movie this long. I like the portrayal of both the jail and the racially tense atmosphere that is brought out during the course of the movie. The racial atmosphere changes as time progresses and this is true with reality, things became more tolerant as time passed with pockets of hate still existing. This is nothing new and it exists in reality, this was a good feature to make visible as it gave the movie a grander more realistic feel to it. I also like how the jail cell that Ruben Carter was kept in changed along with the conditions of the jail. Time doesn't stand still for anyone and things change over time as this the case in reality the jail changed and the conditions that the inmates were kept in changed. This attention to detail gives the movie a certain quality that is often lacking in movies today. All in all, The Hurricane is a whirlwind ride of a movie that takes us through the life of a man that was horribly wronged by the system. I highly recommend it, its informative and thoughtful as well as very well done and a pleasure to watch. The movie also points out the importance of being literate. Its definitely one of the best of the year, well last year now, and I think that it should get some of the credit it deserves. Good Luck at the Oscars!

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"The Hurricane (1999) Rating (out of five): **** Starring Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Dan Hedaya, Debbi Morgan, David Paymer, Vinny Pastore and Rod Steiger Directed by Norman Jewison Written by Sam Chaiton (based on a book by Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter) Rated R for violence and profanity Theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 Released in 1999 Running 155 minutes The life story of boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter is full of so many powerful and harrowing emotions that you'd think it would be impossible to express it all on a movie screen. Filled to the brim with themes of hope, love, sacrifice and courage, The Hurricane is one of the most absorbing and spiritually uplifting movies of the year. Denzel Washington's new film tells Carter's turbulent story in admirable fashion, providing those of us who previously knew nothing of the Hurricane' s plight with a wealth of fascinating insight. How turbulent was his life, you may ask? For starters, at age eleven, Carter was sent to a juvenile prison (and remained there for almost ten years) for a simple act of self-defense, and in his adult life was framed for three murders by the same police officer who haunted his childhood. But Carter carried the title of ""the Hurricane"" for a reason - for the twenty years that he was held in the custody of New Jersey state, he never submitted to his oppressors, nor did he give up his dignity by wearing the uniform of a convict. While behind bars, he became friend and mentor to a troubled black youth who read the memoirs of the wrongly-jailed boxer and was so struck by the tale that he formed a pen pal relationship with the Hurricane. It was he, along with a group of Canadian freedom fighters, that eventually helped to orchestrate Carter's extradition from prison (made even more compelling by a heated courtroom finish in which the hero must stand up to the racist legal system that ruined his life). Of course, who knows exactly how much of the information we are being fed is true? Rumor has it that the real Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter was not such a pleasant guy, that the touched-up film version of his life smoothed out the rougher edges of his personality in order to make their hero more likable and accessible to the general public. The facts of the case have also been accused of being slightly distorted in an attempt to fit Hollywood's standards of a ""crowd-pleaser"" (indeed, the storytelling techniques can seem a little too by-the-numbers at times). Then again, The Hurricane never claimed to be a documentary. Employing the concept of artistic license to its fullest potential, director Norman Jewison (who, after In the Heat of the Night, is no stranger to films dealing with racism) has crafted a fine picture. Aided by a stellar cast of performers (including Washington, who just recently took home a Golden Globe for his turn as the world-weary boxer), he has made something to move and inspire us all. *Find all of Jason's reviews at http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Boulevard/7475 The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Starring Denzel Washington, John Hannah, Live Schreiber, Deborah Kara Unger, Viscellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya, Harris Yulin, David Paymer, Clancy Brown, and Rod Steiger. Directed by Norman Jewison Written by Armayan Bernstein and Dan Gordon Denzel Washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances. This perhaps may be Washington's very best to date. He joins Matt Damon and Jim Carrey in having the talent, this season, to become his character, copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly. His very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting ""The Hurricane"" a much better film than it actually is. When his Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter feels pain and is tormented by racism, he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy, disgust, and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices. The horrific true events Carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago. The powerful expressions of Denzel Washington alone, as his tortured Carter, sum up the troubles of racism in America's history. He is that amazing. The problem with ""The Hurricane"" is that when compared to Washington, all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles. Mainly because the script focuses so much on Carter, that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors. This is, without a doubt, Washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying, it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars. Denzel Washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance. As Rubin Carter, we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white American court system. >From the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit. Then after a successful marriage and boxing career, he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder. Carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous, powerful white men who refused to let him succeed. From these past experiences in jail, Carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of America. After several court appeals, an autobiography, and many public marches for his freedom, Carter remained locked in prison. It was not until a young black boy from Brooklyn being educated in Toronto read Carter's book in the 1980's, that a serious battle for freedom took place. The young boy and his three Canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until Carter is released. The greatest scenes in the film are when Carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation. Washington really shows the breakdown of Carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again, he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career. The devastation in Washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it. In the hole, Carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot. His anger is heightened to a point of no control. We see multiple Carters, a violent angry one, a silent passive one, and a mediator. We see an emotional boxing match inside Carter's head. From this point in the hole to the end of the film, this fight continues. It is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite. When Carter sees that white Canadians want to help him get out of prison, the angry Carter at first erupts. White people have been trying to hurt him his whole life, this reminder leads to anger in his head. However, as the film continues and the Canadians continue to help Carter we see the calm side him. He realizes that society is changing. That racism is decreasing and now Carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world. Very rarely have I seen such determination to perfect his role as Washington has done here. If only the other actors had this same determination. Dan Hedaya, ridiculously plays the man who sends Carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around. It felt like his character was taken straight out of a ""Scooby Doo"" episode; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids. ""The kids"" in this film are the three Canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with Carter underdeveloped and unbelievable. The lawyers who help release Carter also are underused, as is Clancy Brown as a kind prison guard (the complete opposite of his character in ""Shawshank Redemption""). There is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears. Hedaya was superb in ""Clueless,"" same for David Paymer in ""Get Shorty,"" Harris Yulin in ""Ghostbusters"" and Liev Schreiber in ""The Daytrippers."" It is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles. On the other hand, it is absolutely no mystery why Denzel Washington agreed to play Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter. This role is about as far off from shallow as you can get. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"THE HURRICANE (Universal Pictures)- Norman (`Moonstruck') Jewison's latest film is a biopic of former boxer Ruben `Hurricane' Carter, who, in the mid-60's, was framed for the murder of three white men and sentenced to life in prison. Carter's story (which Bob Dylan immortalized in his song, `Hurricane') is an important one, and it involves the topic of racial injustice, which Norman Jewison depicted to perfection in films such as `In The Heat Of The Night', `A Soldier's Story' and even `Fiddler On The Roof' . But in order to truly express my disappointment at `The Hurricane', I must quote fellow critic Roger Ebert. `Movies aren't about what they're about,' he says. `They're about how they're about what they're about.' Jewison has the story (and the 2 1/2 hour running time) for an epic, but the script (by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon) and direction are wildly unfocused, making this `Hurricane' a near-disaster. Luckily, Denzel Washington plays Ruben Carter, and his performance is riveting throughout. Carter's jail scenes are more than watchable, but they do not make up the core of the film. Instead, `The Hurricane' is about Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a teenager who is so moved by Carter's biography that he starts to visit the convict and attempt to free him. But their friendship is portrayed in such melodramatic fashion that all feeling is lost, and we end up with a dull movie about a boy trying to solve a murder-mystery. Jewison adds a thick layer of cheese on what could have been an intense emotional experience. Not exactly what I expected from the last film to be released this millennium. Supposedly, Universal Pictures is expecting to garner some Oscars for this `inspirational true story', but Denzel Washington's intense portrayal is the only reason to see this otherwise atrocious excuse for a film. But what do I know? `The Hurricane' was praised at this year's Cannes Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation. There is a good film somewhere at the core of this mess, and with some major editing, maybe the viewers will be able to see it. Norman Jewison may be an experienced filmmaker, but to me, real experience is knowing that films are about more than they're about.(opens December 29 in limited release) Get FREE voicemail, fax and email at http://voicemail.excite.com Talk online at http://voicechat.excite.com The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Starring-Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Kara Unger and John Hannah Director-Norman Jewison Canadian Rating-PG Released by Universal Pictures - 01/00 `The Hurricane', the true story of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin `Hurricane' Carter, is obviously a burden of love on behalf on the filmmakers. In particular, the commendable effort of Canadian director Norman Jewison speaks nothing but painstaking dedication. Jewison has extracted every possible ounce of compelling drama out of Carter's inspirational battle for justice, and channeled it into a stunningly powerful biography. The man with center-stage, however, is Denzel Washington. Washington's commanding, heartfelt performance as the title character only further justifies the fact that he could be the best actor working in Hollywood today. His seductive puppy-dog eyes and polished speech mannerisms entrance the viewer, and from there, the effortless nuance and understated power of character take over. Washington's deeply affecting portrayal of The Hurricane is just another impressive file to add into the great performance cabinet of 1999, but there is something that makes this one stand out. Perhaps it's because his characterization is based upon that of an actual individual, and that Carter's story is already compelling and touching before being formatted to a theatrical biography. But it's Denzel who goes that extra yard to identify with the racial injustice that Carter dealt with, and all the while remaining loyal and true to his story. It's almost unfortunate that bits and pieces of `The Hurricane' are too conventional, and that dramatic authority is lacking during a few crucial moments. The Hurricane's story begins in the boxing ring, just as Carter has upset the favored defender and become the new Welter Weight Champion. But there is one determined obstacle in his journey to fame: racism. Carter is wrongly accused for a multiple-homicide by a racist police officer (Dan Hedaya) who has hounded him since he was 11-years old. Of course, the ruling tips in favor of his guilt, and in 1966 Carter is sentenced to prison for the remainder of his natural life. At this point, Jewison has more than persuaded the audience that the world is a cruel and unjust place. But there is a faint light of hope at the end of The Hurricane's tunnel, and that hope lies within a small group of Canadians who would rally to set him free. Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a Brooklyn youth being tutored in Toronto by three Canadian adults, manages to find a copy of The Hurricane's autobiography, `The Sixteenth Round'. Lesra is deeply moved by the story, and feels compelled to meet Carter in person and somehow bring his case to a Federal court. `The Hurricane' is powerful stuff. Mind you, it's also a constant uphill battle to establish some of the essential dramatic details. Jewison crafts a beautiful story with a potent emotional backbone, only fumbling the ball on a few childhood flashbacks, which are brief and rather unconvincing. All of the performances are stellar. Although they are never granted more than a peripheral outlook, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Kara Unger and John Hannah are excellent in their roles as the courageous Canadian trio who fight valiantly for Hurricane's freedom. Dan Hedaya succeeds in making us want to put his character through a meat grinder. The remainder of supporting cast includes David Paymer and Rod Steiger, both playing small but equally pivotal roles. The screenplay in `The Hurricane' borders on cliché too often, including an excessive good cop-bad cop scenario, but the performances and steadfast direction never taper off course. Washington's performance is a great one in a semi-great movie. Another component that is thankfully added is the believable and ultimately heartfelt relationship between Rubin and Lesra. There is a sense of discovery with their interaction together. It's a great feeling, just as it must have been for the real Hurricane upon his first meeting with this young Brooklyn lad who had identified with his novel. This feel-good message adds fuel to the powerful fire of `The Hurricane', and helps it overcome the conventional flaws that simmer within it's screenplay. Of course, it all boils down to the Canadians gathering information and connecting the dots of various witness statements to find the proper documents for the courts to release Hurricane from prison. Even though the finale is slightly melodramatic and easy to anticipate, the message of `The Hurricane' radiates throughout this inspirational biography. `Hate put me in prison. Love's gonna bust me out'. As soon as Washington speaks these words, we realize our journey has been worthwhile. Just as justice does for Mr. Rubin Carter, `The Hurricane' prevails in the end.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Norman Jewison's attachment to racial issues in film is hardly new for the great director. Before 'The Hurricane', he has tackled the issue with two of Hollywood's more under appreciated films, 'In the Heat of the Night' and 'A Soldier's Story' (which helped Denzel Washington gain major recognition). Neither film made the 1998 list of 100 greatest films as selected by the American Film Institute and the latter wasn't even a nominee in the final 400 nominees out of 40,000 American films from the first century of film 1896-1996. In fact, from 'The Cincinnati Kid' to 'Fiddler on the Roof' to 'Moonstruck', Jewison didn't get a film on the final 100 list and that's a travesty. As a fellow countryman from Canada, I admire Jewison's trek to get international recognition and he still may win an Oscar one day. But 'The Hurricane' won't earn him one. This is an absorbing but slow moving motion picture that only has one great performance from a cast that could have performed in top fashion but didn't. Many films have one great performance that save them from failure. Michael Douglas' Oscar winning performance in 1987's 'Wall Street' (the film received no other Oscar nominations) was the only thing that helped the film fight off charges that it was a sexist and chauvinistic portrayal of high rollers in the financial world. The film was also criticized for its nasty portrayal of bankers and stock traders as all being evil, weak minded or completely greedy. Jack Palance's Oscar win in the 1991 caper 'City Slickers' (the film received no other Oscar nominations) was more than a career award. In my opinion, Palance truly deserved to win but many thought it was a year in which the Oscar then should have gone to Anthony Hopkins in the supporting category for 'The Silence of the Lambs' (Hopkins WON in the lead best actor category for having less than half an hour on screen in a two hour film) and to Warren Beatty in 'Bugsy' in the leading actor category. And finally, Marisa Tomei's performance in 1992's 'My Cousin Vinny' earned her a best supporting actress Oscar and the film, again, received no other Oscar nominations. At the time of this review, Denzel Washington stands alone in this film as the only Oscar nominee. He is nominated in the best actor category for 'The Hurricane' and stands a good chance of winning. His courageous performance as a man standing almost alone against the system is one that reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance in 1993's 'In the Name of the Father' as a man wrongly sent to prison. In 'The Hurricane' Denzel Washington portrays Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. In the late 1960's, he was on his way to a glorious and successful boxing career before it ended tragically at the satanic hands of racism. The film states that a New Jersey police officer name Det. Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) helped frame Carter in a multiple murder case and sent him to prison for over 20 years before Carter had any real chance for his case to be heard with new evidence. Della Pesca had a run-in with Carter when Carter was a little boy as Carter was brought in for assault (actually self defense) at about the age of 10. It was as situation where the boy looked guilty but was very much innocent. Carter writes a book about his trials and tribulations and many years after his incarceration, Carter's book about his unjust prison sentence finds its way into the hands of Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a young black teenager from Brooklyn, New York whose parents are alcoholics and Lesra is adopted by a group of young Canadian commune individuals from Toronto, Ontario, and is in part, raised by them in learning how to read and write and be sent off to college to pursue his dream of becoming an attorney. Lesra's passion is to meet Rubin Carter face to face in prison and tell him that he believes in his cause and offers to help fight his conviction with the help of his Canadian pals. Their investigation sheds new light on Carter's possible innocence and the information is presented before the law for serious consideration. Denzel Washington does it again. He plays a real life character as he did in his first Oscar nominated role as Steven Biko in 1987's 'Cry Freedom' and his only other Oscar nomination in a leading role to date is for 1992's 'Malcolm X'. Washington lets the layers of his acting ability do the talking like other actors such as Gene Hackman, Nicolas Cage and Tom Hanks who all use very little if no make-up and rely on good old fashioned academics to enhance a movie. As Rubin Carter, Washington has many points in the film where he flat out carries the film himself. 'The Hurricane' is long, drawn out and worth one viewing as far as I'm concerned but Denzel Washington does his job and the film only thrives when he's on screen and many would argue he's absent in this film a bit too much. Still worth a marginal recommendation, however, for Washington's amazing performance.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member James Brundage.

All right. So this is an empty threat. I have zero way of knowing whether or not you are humming the Bob Dylan song just to spite me, but please don't do it anyway. After seeing The Hurricane, I have Bob Dylan stuck in my head. In fact, Bob Dylan and Denzel Washington are about the only things stuck in my head after that movie that and enormous sense of racial injustice and a newfound respect for the residents of Toronto. The Hurricane is the story of Rubin `Hurricane' Carter, welterweight champion who was wrongfully imprisoned for a triple-murder that he didn't commit. To clear this up to younger readers, this actually happened. Although the wrongfully-imprisoned genre film is terribly passé at this point in time, having a falsely accused man in prison is something worth making into a movie again. The question, walking into The Hurricane, was whether making a `wrongfully accused' movie is a viable option after the genre has been sucked dry by fictional (or semi-fictional) counterparts such as The Fugitive, U.S. Marshals, Double Jeopardy, and Wrongfully Accused. To its credit, The Hurricane shows us that such a film is possible. Most of the credit in this case goes to Denzel Washington, who I now am absolutely sure deserved the Golden Globe he won for Best Actor. Washington is in flawless form here, pushing every emotional button in the book. He is able to take a character that would otherwise be contrived and make it into something new and impressive. The film is carried squarely on Washington's shoulders, and the result is a potentially terrible film is turned into something that jerks a tear or two out of even the most heartless of viewer (or critic). The big flaws in the movie come in the form of the writers, who are dead-set convinced that the story of Rubin Carter (which, face it, would have been better as a documentary) needed a little extra oomph. To add said oomph, the film takes poetic license and creates a corrupt cop (Den Heyada) out of thin air. To add even more oomph, the film takes more poetic license with the do-good Canucks (Schrieber, Unger, and Hannah), who are portrayed as the major detectives of the film. Being as the film is more based-on-a-true story than actual biopic, the Canucks are placed in a large degree of artificial danger from a possibly imaginary web of New Jersey corruption stretching all of the way up to Christie Todd Whitman (all right, to whomever was New Jersey's governor at the time). We know the Garden State is screwy, but not that screwy. Said poetic license, contrived events and characters, make The Hurricane terribly difficult for anyone who is an admirer of Rubin Carter to take easily. Scorcese fans, on the other hand, will be undoubtedly pissed by the Raging Bull knock-offs that pose as fight scenes. In the end, however, when all is said and done, Denzel Washington has made pearls out of swine. Without Denzel Washington, The Hurricane would just be another contrived prison-drama, whether or not it actually happened. -- Christopher Null - cnull@mindspring.com - http://www.filmcritic.com The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"The Hurricane (1999) Rated R; running time 146 minutes Genre: Drama IMDB site: http://us.imdb.com/Details?0174856 Official site: http://www.universalpictures.com/hurricane/ Written by: Written by Armyan Bernstein (based on the book by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter) Directed by: Norman Jewison Starring:Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya, Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Debbi Morgan, David Paymer, Harris Yulin, Clancy Brown, Rod Steiger, Garland Whitt Review Copyright Rose Cooper, 2000 Review URL: http://www.3blackchicks.com/bamshurricane.html If you've either never heard the true story of Rubin ""The Hurricane"" Carter and how he was imprisoned for more than 20 years for crimes he didn't commit, or you can't infer whether he was released or not from the tone of the trailers that have been shown, you might not want to read this review, since I'll be pulling no punches in telling what happened at the end. After all, I respect my readers' intelligence. The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**): A strong contender for the middleweight boxing title during the 60s, Rubin ""The Hurricane"" Carter's (Denzel Washington) hopes were dashed when he and John Artis (Garland Whitt) were sentenced to three life terms and imprisoned for 20 years for murders he didn't commit. This is his story... ...and it is also the story of an unlikely group of folks from Canada (one, by way of Brooklyn): Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a young Black teen from Brooklyn, being homeschooled in Toronto by three White Canadians, Lisa Peters (Deborah Unger), Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber), and Terry Swinton (John Hannah). By a strange twist of fate, Lesra finds a book written by Rubin about his unjust imprisonment, and he is so moved by it and his feverent belief in Rubin's innocence, that he convinces the Canadians to help him set Rubin free. But not without a fight; they come up against pure evil, in the form of Det. Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya), a dirty, racist cop who's been after Carter for years, and does all he can to see that Rubin remains locked up. The Upshot (WARNING: **more spoilers contained below**) Let me get this out of the way: Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, and Dan Hedaya were outstanding in this film. Washington, we've seen go ""all-out"" before, so his strong performance didn't surprise me at all. Hedaya is one of those character actors that you know you've seen a million time, but can't put your finger on where, exactly; he's played Funny (""Cheers"") as well as straight drama (""Nixon""), but never before has he sent chills down my spine as he did here. But Shannon really impressed me in the strangest of ways: every time he spoke, I said to myself, ""his voice and his body don't match"". For some reason, I kept expecting to hear a ""softer"" voice, but sure enough, his heavy Brooklyn accent came through each time. But beyond that, Shannon's portrayal of Lesra's passionate belief in Rubin, and in his place in Rubin's life, astonished me--and will hopefully move him beyond the Obligatory Thug Roles that the IMDB lists him as having played so frequently in the past (if there's any justice in Hollywood. Notice that I'm not holding my breath). The story itself, though moving, felt somewhat hollow. Though of course Rubin couldn't know what became of John Artis while they were both in prison, I felt short-changed by the offhand mention of him throughout the film, and especially at the end. I also got somewhat dizzy during the flashback/flashforward sequences; though the boxing scenes were beautifully shot in black and white, they felt cut-n-pasted on, and I could never fully understand their true significance to the story being told. And one has to wonder how, after Rubin's lawyers Myron Beldoc (David Paymer) and Harris Yulin (Leon Friedman) spent ten years on a case that was heard by two juries, the Canadians could come along and...well, see for yourself. Something else bothered me, involving Rubin's wife, Mae Thelma (Debbie Morgan) and the scene from the trailers which show Rubin telling her to ""bury him"". Unfortunately, saying exactly what bothered me, would call for more spoilage than I'm prepared to do, so I'll have to wait to discuss this with the curious reader after they've has seen the movie. Still, in spite of its padding (a half-hour could've easily been excised from this movie, with little detriment), ""The Hurricane"" spins a good tale; fractured, in places, but still told reasonably well. Besides the performances of the three leads mentioned above, most of the other cast seemed pretty mute. Liev Schreiber was almost invisible in a role that one would think would provide ample opportunity for him to shine in--especially since his character's (Sam Chaiton) book is given a writing credit in the film. Unger and Hannah were almost as marginal; until their stint at private eye-ism, they could just as well have been shown as Lesra's babysitters, to no real detriment to the story. And what a wasted opportunity the movie's Powers That Be made in not using Clancy Brown to his fullest potential; he's played prison guards enough before that casting him as Jimmy Williams, the Guard With A Heart (But Not Much To Do), made little sense to me. But still, not as little sense as the casting of Rod Steiger as Judge H. Lee Sorokin. Maybe I'm the only one who saw ""Crazy In Alabama"", and therefore, saw Steiger's Judge there. Played as an absolute loon in that film, Steiger worked; here, he was just more flotsam. But maybe I'm too picky. The use of period music throughout the film was excellent, even Bob ""damn, I can't sing!"" Dylan's song, ""Hurricane"", written during the time when Dylan was one of a few celebrities (along with Ellen Burstyn and Muhammad Ali) who were trying to get Rubin set free early on in his sentence. Their involvement (or lack thereof) over time was a key point made by Beldoc, when Lesra and the Canadians came to confront him in what Beldoc surely saw as Guilty White Liberalism at its worst. The ""Black Factor"" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]: Actually, since the BF is pretty clear in this flick, consider this space The ""White Factor"". And let's go one step further: since Della Pesca's (and those like him) rabid racism need no explanation, let's examine the ""Guilty White Liberal Factor"", shall we? Guilty White Liberals make an easy target; they seem to come in like a whirlwind, upset the status quo, do what they see as The Right Thing for those poor heathens who they deem worthy of their patronage, and leave after their Guilt is assuaged, right? Well, maybe. And maybe the three Guilty White Liberals from Canada took pity on both Rubin and Lesra, and by helping them, they purged themselves of their Guilt long enough to look back at their lives and feel they've Done Good--much to the consternation of those other poor heathens left behind in their wake who weren't so lucky as to gain the favor of those Guilty White Liberals. Maybe that's the way some see it. To those ""some"", ask yourself this: is Rubin still in that prison? And as for the fellow (self-identified as being White) who, after he read Diva's ""The Hurricane"" review, took it upon himself to scold 3BC, saying we should be ashamed for not slamming ""The Hurricane"" for deifying those Guilty White Liberals? Pardon my French, but he can baise mon bel noir ane. Bammer's Bottom Line Overall, a powerful story that feels padded in spots (especially those involving the Danger! the Canadians were in, and how they so ""easily"" did what others couldn't do over the period of 15 or so years. Yeah, right.), featuring bravura performances by Washington, Shannon, and Hedaya that should not be missed, but will likely be ignored come Oscar night.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Cast: Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Unger, John Hannah, Dan Hedaya, David Paymer, Rod Steiger Director: Norman Jewison Screenplay: Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, based on ""Lazarus and The Hurricane"" by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton, and ""The 16th Round"" by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter 150 minutes Rated R In this corner, the master of playing the Negro oppressed by the white man, the two-time Oscar nominee (Cry Freedom & Malcolm X) and once Oscar winner (Glory), the thespian, the one and only Denzel Washington! And in the other corner, the master craftsman of the clichéd & manipulative (Bogus), the thrice Oscar nominated (In The Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof & Moonstruck) and Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award recipient, the man with the plan, Norman Jewison! Together for the first time since ""A Soldier's Story,"" in a film based on ""Lazarus and The Hurricane"" by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton, and on ""The 16th Round"" by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. Ladies and gentleman, ""The Hurricane!"" The film opens on December 20, 1963 with an awesome black and white boxing match (shot elaborately by Roger Deakins) between Rubin and Griffith. From that point on, the film never ceases to amaze us. Presented in a non-linear form with a heavy dosage of drama, and solid acting across the board, ""Hurricane"" ends up a real KO. Of admirable merit are Jewison's top-notch directing, Denzel Washington's superbly complex and multi-layered performance and the fascinating story of Carter adapted for the screen by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon. Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter was a great boxer, possibly one of the greatest of all time. The film chronicles his life from childhood to his wrongful murder conviction because of a corrupt cop (Dan Hedaya) to his triumphant release from prison. How he got out of jail after being imprisoned for 20 years is an ""incredible"" true story. After reading Carter's book, Lesra Martin feels a deep connection between himself and the author and decides to seek him out. He writes a letter and after getting a reply, visits Hurricane in jail. The two have a meaningful conversation that makes Lesra enlist the help of the three Canadians (Liev Schreiber, Deborah Unger & John Hannah) he's living with to come and help him free Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter. Denzel Washington does a great job of playing African Americans oppressed by the Caucasian race as evidenced by his multiple awards for playing those kinds of roles. He's the best at doing characters like Malcolm X in ""Malcolm X,"" Trip in ""Glory,"" or Rubin Carter in ""The Hurricane."" He has the ability to transform into these characters, both physically and mentally. Washington gave this film everything he had and it shows. Throughout ""Hurricane,"" there's not one scene where we're watching Denzel Washington, we're always watching Rubin. In my humble opinion, I think he gives the best male performance of 1999. In addition to Washington, there's a great supporting cast headed by Vicellous Reon Shannon. It gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside to say that this is a talented young actor that we should keep an eye on, especially with this being the year of praise heaped upon such overrated prodigies as Haley Joel Osment. Shannon shows a skillful amount of range in his role of Lesra Martin, a role that will probably go underrated. Then there's Dan Hedaya, resplendent as always as the conspicuous police lieutenant who's trying to keep the black man (In this case, Rubin Carter) down. There's nothing like a really good antagonist to make a film complete. Unless of course, it's the king of over the top actors, Rod Steiger! Fresh from the ruins of ""End of Days,"" he's here in a superincumbent role as the judge for the big courtroom climax. With so many biographies being made into films these days, it's refreshing to see one as good as this. ""The Hurricane"" is one that actually had everyone pour their heart and soul into it.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"""The Hurricane"" is hands down the most powerful film of 1999. Although it has a few minor flaws, one can't help hide it's uplifting message, not to mention a breakthrough for both Denzel Washington and director Norman Jewison. As you may or may not know, the film follows the life of the famous boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, Hurricane being his nickname. The film starts out with a murder that was pinned on Rubin, but only we know that he's been wrongfully accused. The story then focuses on a young boy named Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who is struggling in life as well, until he reads the autobiography of Rubin Carter, which gives him a little inspiration. So the background story of Rubin basically unfolds as Lesra reads the novel. After he finishes the book, he is determined to help Rubin out by any means, and he does with a little help from his friends (Liev Schriber, Deborah Kara Unger and John Hannah). This leads us to the 2nd part of the film, in which all 4 people investigate the crime, so that they can give Rubin Carter a fair trial. I'll admit, I thought the trailer was a bit sappy, but I must have came into the movie with an open heart, because I was blown away by it's emotional impact. Sure it was formulaic and had a simple premise, but there was far more to it then. A story is only a small portion of the film. The film's messages are what really worked here, not to mention Denzel Washington's performance, which I will get into later. The film mainly deals with the racism (in the first half of the film) towards black men and woman during the 60's, and how they were treated improperly, while the second half dealt with the inner struggle to survive with love and hate by your side. It may not seem like much in words, but is far more descriptive on screen. Absolutely uplifting. Unfortunately there are a few flaws. The whole investigation in the film seemed to have brought it down a notch. I would have rather seen more of Washington or something with meaning rather than these empty scenes. It just didn't quite fit. Also as I said before, it is a typical Hollywood film with a formulaic story. If it was not for that, it would have easily been an excellent film, but it falls slightly below that. Now for the real knockout in the film, Denzel Washington. Not only is this his greatest performance, but it's also the best of 99. If someone else was in his position, I doubt it would have been as believable, nor as powerful. He delivered here big time. He's got an Oscar Nomination in the bag, maybe even a win as well. Everyone else in the film did a good job as well. Director Norman Jewison has a hit on his hands for once. I have never really been impressed with his work (with the exception of Moonstruck) up until now. He has outdone himself and it's about time he's put his good direction skills to work. I suggest you go see ""The Hurricane"" ASAP, because quite frankly next to ""The Green Mile"" and ""Toy Story 2"" it's one of the best films playing in theaters now. A must see.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Reviewed by Harvey Karten Universal Studios/Beacon Pictures Director: Norman Jewison Writer: Armyan Bernstein, Christopher Cleveland Cast: John Hannah, Dan Hedaya, David Paymer, Liev Schreiber, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Rod Steiger, Deborah Kara Unger, Denzel Washington Coincidentally, Univeral has released two movies at the same time dealing with the theme of injustice toward members of minority groups. One is ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" in which a Japanese-American is on trial for the murder of a white man. The other is ""The Hurricane,"" in which an African-American is found guilty of murder and incarcerated for nineteen years. To plagiarize a paragraph from my own ""Cedars"" review....When O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, critics of the jury system and of lawyers' tactics were quick to pounce on the verdict. Given the racial makeup of the jury and the defense team's alleged playing of the race card, cynics and detractors in general were quick to say that the decision was based not on the evidence but on the willingness of minority jurors to free an African-American simply because of his race. What we all know, though, is that the situation has almost always been the reverse: jurors have been prone to find innocent people guilty if the defendants were members of minority groups. Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter is a perfect example of a man convicted by a jury that was swayed by a prosecution team suffused with racial prejudice. That point is made convincingly enough in the film's most cynically humorous line. When two patrolmen pull over a car carrying the title character (Denzel Washington) on his way home, one remarks, ""We're looking for two Negroes in a white car."" Responds Carter, ""Any two will do?"" Norman Jewison's biopic is a dramatization of a major segment of the life of a Paterson, New Jersey prizefighter who had defeated Emile Griffith in 1963 to become the welterweight champion of the world. Like many who take up boxing as a way to enter the middle class, Carter came from a back of poverty and was in trouble with the police since he had stabbed a prominent white man in self-defense. From the time he was arrested and sent to a juvenile home, he was pursued by a modern Javert, Police Lieutenant Della Pesce--described as a bulldog with glasses (Dan Hedaya)--determined to frame Carter for a triple murder he did not commit. The film is as high-minded as similar works like ""Chariots of Fire"" and, like the football film ""Any Given Sunday"" which was released just days before its opening, gives the audience a taste of the legalized violence which is part and parcel of contact sports. Unfortunately, although director Norman Jewison utilizes the usual tricks of the trade such as frequent flashbacks, the story is told in a conventional manner more suited to HBO television than to the big screen. Featuring an impressive performance by the always reliable Denzel Washington (who lost 40 pounds for the role), ""The Hurricane"" is a feel-good movie with a razzle-dazzle ending that could conceivable bring an audience to its feet at the conclusion. But Jewison brings little imagination to his dramatization, turning the story into a disappointingly straight bad cop-good victim yarn. Jewison splits his camera into two segments: one deals with the struggle that The Hurricane undergoes to transcend his boyhood days as a victim of a racially biased judicial system that sent him away and motivated him to turn his body into a weapon. The other focuses on a Brooklyn-raised teen, Lesa Martin (Vicellous Shannon) whom the local school system was unable to reach and who is now living in Toronto with three unusual white people who had observed his intelligence and are tutoring him--Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (the British actor, John Hannah). Finding Carter's memoirs, ""The 16th Round,"" at a library sale, Lesra is inspired and becomes bent on communicating with the prisoner and doing what he can to get the man freed. Norman Jewison comes prepared for a movie like this one, having directed ""In the Heat of the Night"" in 1967, a crime thriller with racial overtones. That story of a redneck southern sheriff who accepts the help of a black detective to solve a murder seems tougher, more atmospheric, with more cinematic effects that his current offering. Though Carter was not exonerated for the crime but rather freed because a federal judge (Rod Steiger) found the case tainted by racial bigotry, Jewsion makes the man a saint. The picture is all too solemn, the somewhat fictionalized epistolary exchange between Carter and the unconvincing Lesra dragging the tale down to terminal solmenity. Rated R.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"_The_Hurricane_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****) The title of _The_Hurricane_ is not only the nickname of its main character, boxer Rubin Carter, but also an apt description of the work of Carter's portrayer, Denzel Washington. Forceful, dynamic, and wholly natural, Washington's performance ranks among the very best of his illustrious career--a turn so strong that it easily smooths over the rough patches in Norman Jewison's fact-based drama. And there a few rough patches, especially in the early stages of the film. We get to know Carter by way of one Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a young American in Canada, as he reads Carter's autobiography, _The_Sixteenth_Round_. The book details Carter's rise up the middleweight ranks through the moment where it was cut short in 1966, when he and another man were wrongly convicted of the fatal shootings of three people. Racism played a major part in the conviction, in particular that of one detective (Dan Hedaya) who had been out to nail Carter since his days as a criminally-inclined youth. The events as depicted in the film have some basis in fact, but the portrayal of this detective doesn't quite ring true, for he is made into such a simplistically shady character that he appears to have wandered in from an old silent melodrama (all he's missing is a twirly moustache). Similarly over-the-top initially is Shannon's portrayal of Lesra, who originally hails from a rough American neighborhood; Shannon lays on Lesra's straight-from-the-ghetto mannerisms a bit too thick at the start to adequately engage one's sympathies. That changes once the meat of _The_Hurricane_'s story kicks into gear. Lesra is so deeply inspired by Carter's book that he begins a correspondence with the inmate, and Lesra convinces his Canadian guardians (played by Deborah Kara Unger, John Hannah, and Liev Schreiber) to help in a campaign to clear Carter's name and free him from prison. While the efforts to free The Hurricane is a major issue in the film, of even greater importance is the relationship between Carter and Lesra. Once paired with Washington, Shannon's awkwardness disappears, and the two successfully make their characters' friendship into a most involving and touching heart for the film. That is but one example of how greatly Washington elevates _The_Hurricane_. Although the film gets off to an imperfect start, his charisma and rapport with the audience instantly commands the audience's attention and emotional investment. When the campaign to overturn Carter's conviction takes precedence (and as such do the three Canadians) the film threatens to become one of those ""white people save the black man"" films, but Washington's intense presence prevents that from happening. While the Canadians do the legwork, one never forgets that it is Carter who is in charge of his own destiny. It's easy to compliment Washington's performance strictly on the basis of its force and focus (and how could one not, when his commitment to the role is physically manifested by his sculpted boxer's physique?), but what makes his work especially memorable are his more subdued moments. In addition to the warm scenes with Lesra, particularly noteworthy are the couple of scenes where Carter's internal struggles are spelled out by having Carter being torn between two other Carters--an angry one and a weak one. The device is a variation of the time-worn gimmick of having and an angel on one shoulder and a devil on another, but it is completely effective, for Washington is able to convincingly convey all facets of Carter's personality--a feat he also manages when just playing the singular Carter. Washington's deft handling of the tri-Carter device is analagous to the relationship between the actor and all of _The_Hurricane_: while the whole undertaking is of a conventional mold, Washington is able to make it into something more. Granted, Jewison, with the aid of screenwriters Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, do put enough pressure on the right emotional buttons themselves, and Carter's true story is indeed one gripping and inspiring enough that the film could have very well worked without Washington. However, one cannot imagine it working nearly as well with someone else in the lead. _The_Hurricane_ is not a piece of cinematic greatness, but on Washington's mighty shoulders, it often flirts with becoming one.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Starring Denzel Washington, John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev Schreiber, Dan Hedaya, Vicellous Reon Shannon. Rated R. Some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high Oscar potential that when they're finally released, everyone just goes along with it. Thus sometimes, films unworthy of any award sans the Razzie become Oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations. Last year it was The Thin Red Line. This year's ""winner"" is The Hurricane, pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office Oscar pool. Acclaimed director Norman Jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun. And that's supposed to be ok because, see, it's a true story. It's about Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Denzel Washington), a legendary African American prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly (racist!) detective (Dan Hedaya) who's had it in for the ""big-shot"" Hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife (in self-defense but who cares, right?) when Rubin was only ten. He is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole. Most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison. To the rescue -- Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) and his team of wanna-be detectives. Lesra is an African American teenager taken in by three well-off Canadian white people (Hanna, Unger, Schreiber) to get an education. Lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where Lesra picks out his very first book -- ""The Sixteenth Round,"" Rubin's autobiography. Immediately thereafter, Schreiber's character tells Lesra ""Sometimes we don't pick the books we read, they pick us."" Hmmm. After a few visits to the prison, they become convinced of Rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him. They meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses (I wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces?) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the Hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings. Of course, we're already told that he's innocent. A movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to Carter during this period in his life. All too obviously, we're getting the Hollywood watered- down version. That would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it. It's almost cruel. The melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either; it's the hokey, rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists. The Hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie. It's formula stripped to the bare necessities. You have your wrongly accused black man. You have your melodramatic final courtroom scene. But there's nothing else. You'd expect some sort of involving investigation. But that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence. Thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding. Brooding to himself. Brooding to other inmates. Brooding to Lesra. Brooding to Lesra's Canadian friends. Brooding in letters. I don't think I'll ever look at brooding the same way again. It wasn't long before I got tired of hearing the Hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition. I wanted something to happen. As for Washington's performance in the title role -- I figured I'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch, though still boring. How is that possible? Well, he does what Jewison wanted him to do perfectly. Unfortunately what Jewison asked him to do is a load of crap. What a waste of a great performer. Speaking of wastes, why the hell did John Hannah agree to do this? He's an extremely talented actor and I love him dearly, but what is he doing here? To call his character (along with Schreiber's and Unger's) a stick figure would be a gross understatement. All three of them come off as veritable Mother Theresas, as benevolent as do-gooders come. If they're to play a major part in this movie, why not make them real people, with real feelings and emotions? Look: if you're going to make a formula movie, don't undermine the formula. Courtroom dramas can be fun, but this is ridiculous. Not only is it trite, it's boring. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com Growing up as the child of dirty hippies, I was introduced to the plight of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter at an early age. Via the Bob Dylan song, I learned that Carter was the number one contender for the middleweight boxing title until he was accused, falsely tried and convicted of a grisly triple murder by an all-white jury. The song also detailed the cover-ups, witness tampering and corruption ranging from the local police to the judge that handed Carter his life sentence. Pretty heavy subject matter for a song (thank God that Dylan was writing in blank verse), not to mention my five-year-old brain. The tale seemed inconceivable, even to a kid whose biggest concern was trying to get the brake on his Big Wheel to make him spin to a groovy halt. Still, I approached the film with apprehension. First, you have to consider the fact that you're basically seeing a movie that will offer no surprises. It's a biopic and, like Man on the Moon, based on real-life events that most people already know. Then there's director Norman Jewison. He's made some decent films, especially when he focuses on racial injustice, but his last two (Bogus and Only You) really stunk up the joint. And then there's Denzel Washington (The Bone Collector), an actor who, in my opinion, is one of the most overrated in the business (it's a photo-finish with Liam Neeson). But since The Hurricane has already been praised by critics worldwide, I felt I should probably check my preconceptions at the box office window. Hurricane is a good film. Is it a Best Picture candidate? Absolutely not. Does it belong on Top Ten lists? Not unless you've only seen two dozen movies in 1999. I'm not even sure that you can call the film entertaining, considering the depressing material and lack of surprises. It is simply a good film. Among its strengths is the way the film is assembled. Instead of going for the simple, linear, timeline approach, Jewison skips from Carter's welterweight title fight in 1963; to the release of his novel, `The 16th Round,' in 1973; to the murders in 1966; to Carter's youth in Patterson, New Jersey; to the `present day,' when a group of Canadians lead a fight to free the imprisoned boxer. Jewison is able to pull this off without Hurricane seeming too jumpy or confusing. Also commendable is Roger Deakins' (The Big Lebowski) cinematography, which is fantastic without being intrusive. His camera-work, especially during the grainy black-and-white fight, is quite remarkable. At this point in post-Raging Bull cinema, it's almost a requirement that all fight scenes be filmed in black-and-white, but Deakins does more than just use black-and-white stock: He gives these scenes such a dated look that you can almost hear Howard Cosell calling the action. But the biggest surprise of all is Washington, who does a really great job in the titular role. The usually one-dimensional actor manages to appear angry, scared and delusional at the same time. There is one standout scene where he meets with his lawyers and they do that whole talking-on-the-phone-separated-by-a-thick-pane-of-glass thing. Washington gets so worked up that his side of the glass starts to get steamed up. Or maybe he just had really bad gas. Hurricane certainly isn't without flaws, though. It's one slow-moving train, punctuated by a tedious scene of Carter in `the hole.' It feels like we're watching the entire ninety-day ordeal play out in real time. I also have a big problem with the creation of the fictional character Detective Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya, Dick). The detective is portrayed as a bigot that sat around and dreamed up ways to incarcerate Carter. Sound familiar? It should - it's the O.J. defense. While I understand his inclusion intends to illustrate the corruption of the system, it's really hard to swallow. I'm sure that law enforcement officers wish they had this kind of free time on their hands. The character does nothing but potentially incite hatred toward police. And that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 2:25 - R for adult language, violence and racial stuff The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"Entitled ""Hurricane"" and whirling with hype, the film is good, but doesn't quite pack the stormy punch you'd rightfully have anticipated. Less a fight movie, and more a quiet emotional story of one man's endurance in the face of racism and injustice. In a black and white 1966 clip, boxer Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter muscles his helpless competitor to the canvas, woven into this sequence is a color 1974 sequence in which an imprisoned Carter prepares to defend himself against reactionary guards. An excellent introduction after which the film experiences an early lull of about a half-hour. Also the caption ""7 years later"" appears on the screen confusing the time line issue (7 years from '66 or '74?). Carter's autobiography serves as a convenient way to cover past history. The stuttering stubborn boy who plays a child Ruben Carter sets the stage well for the experienced Washington who is very good, but never breaks loose (performance speaking). An hour or so into the film, a black teen (Lesra) home-schooled by three white communal Canadians, becomes engrossed in Carter's book ""The 16th Round."" This is when we as an audience are given a sympathetic eye through which to view the drama. No longer innocent by-standers, we become drawn into the ring by Lesras' passion and compassion. It's the relationship between Ruben and Lesra that gives ""Hurricane"" its thunder. ""Hate put me in prison, Love's gonna bust me out."" The picture is seldom short of this kind of schmaltz and Ruben is nearly always shown in a virtual angelic light. Still, ""Hurricane"" endears, its positive message strongly resonating. Hurricane.

Screenplay: Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, based on _The Sixtheenth Round_ by Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and _Lazarus and the Hurricane_ by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton.

There are times when I'm watching a film and I just know it has fallen victim the demon Expectations. Audiences expect certain things from certain kind of films -- they expect love stories to end with a kiss, they expect horror films to end with a jolt, they expect action films to end with a big chase and/or a big explosion. The ebb and flow of traditional narrative becomes part of the way people watch movies, and film-makers know this. The familiarity is comforting; it makes it easy for people to keep up. Scripts are structured not exactly to give the people what they want, but to give them what they know -- which, for all practical purposes, is the same thing. THE HURRICANE is a drama that follows a legal proceding, and it gives the audience what they expect by ending with a verdict. It's also a disappointing resolution for a story that's actually about so much more than guilt or innocence. The subject is real-life boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Denzel Washington), a middleweight contender whose hard life takes its hardest turn when he is convicted in a robbery/murder case and sentenced to life in prison. Carter never stops insisting on his innocence, however, and eventually turns his story into an autobiography called _The Sixteenth Round_. That book finds its way into the hands of Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon), an African-American teen learning at last to read with the help of three Canadian social activist/guardians: Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Terry (John Hannah) and Sam (Liev Schreiber). When Lesra becomes convinced Carter has been wrongly accused, he enlists the aid of ""The Canadians"" to free ""The Hurricane"" after nearly 20 years in prison. The heart and soul of THE HURRICANE comes from the relationship between Carter and Lesra, a relationship that begins as a pen pal correspondence and climaxes with an emotional prison visit between the two. Once THE HURRICANE finds that hook, it truly begins to soar. The biographical background material, which had felt somewhat labored, starts to flesh out a portrait of Carter's background of distrust of any force outside himself. Denzel Washington, after a number of roles in which his commanding presence was lost on mediocre material, turns Carter into a character with a fascinating arc. After growing inward for years as a defense mechanism, Carter finds himself in the dangerous position of growing to care once again about life in the outside world. Watching him overcome his initial suspicion of the Canadians' motives is intriguing; watching him begin to collapse under the burden of hope is engrossing. That dynamic -- the tense relationships between Carter and those who sought to help him, and how he responds to their efforts -- is what THE HURRICANE is really about. Unfortunately, the script begins taking the story into predictable, uninspired directions. The Canadians encounter road blocks from reluctant would-be witnesses; they're harrassed by the racist police detective (Dan Hedaya) who originally engineered the frame-up. The investigation consistently suffers from a sense of manufactured drama, as well as from the complete absence of character development for the three Canadians (they've been compressed from nine real-life individuals, so we can be thankful for small favors). It's obvious we're heading for a showdown before the bench, and a series of impassioned speeches about justice. And frankly, I didn't really care, because I knew every minute spent on the details of the case was a minute not spent exploring Carter as a character. There is far too much to like about Washington's performance -- and, to give credit where it's due, about newcomer Shannon's performance as well -- for THE HURRICANE not to be ultimately satisfying. The agonizing sequence that finds Carter slowly losing his mind in solitary confinement is a particular triumph; no other film has ever made the loneliness of one's own thoughts seem like such a punishment. THE HURRICANE simply loses focus on its strengths at times, wandering into familiar territory for its emotional catharsis. In a sense, Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon deserve kudos for finding a compelling perspective in fusing their two source materials. It's hard not to wish that the film hadn't been more willing to let the audience find that perspective as well.

"Hurricane, The",Animation,2019,"""Innocence is a highly overrated commodity,"" says Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter. He should know, he's spent most of his life in prison, unjustly accused. The riveting movie, THE HURRICANE, is based on Hurricane Carter's true story. Directed with loving intensity by Norman Jewison (IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT and A SOLDIER'S STORY) and starring Denzel Washington as Hurricane Carter, in a powerfully moving performance, the riveting movie is likely to earn them both Oscar nominations. The script by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, based on the book ""Lazarus and the Hurricane"" by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton and the book ""The 16th Round"" by Carter himself, manages to tell a complex, decades-long story lucidly. Only in the middle section does the director allow his movie to meander for a bit, but he more than makes up for a slack 15 minutes or so with his rousing last act. Cutting back and forth between timeframes, the movie tells Hurricane's story. Starting off in 1963 at the height of his career, we witness his triumphs in the boxing ring as he rises rapidly to become the welterweight champion of the world. ""One thing I could do was box,"" he says in his book, spoken in voice-over by Washington. ""I tasted my own blood, and I loved it."" The boxing matches are shot by Roger Deakins (FARGO) in high-contrast black and white, looking like they did when we watched them on television. (The rest of the movie is in color.) The mainly white, male audiences root for him like Roman senators cheering on their favorite gladiator. Carter, who won fight after fight, frequently with first round knock-outs, rarely disappoints his fans. After we witness his success at capturing the title, we jump abruptly to 10 years later in which Carter, now a prison inmate serving three life sentences, is angry and determined. Jewison convincingly creates Carter as a black Gandhi. Carter starts off his prison stay with 90 days in the hole since he refuses to wear prison uniforms, which he feels would be admitting he was guilty. Jewison makes the movie as much a detective story as a social commentary and biography. Cutting back to the crime scene, we witness two men, reportedly black, walk into a bar in the wee hours of the morning and murder the occupants for no obvious reason. The chances that the current world boxing champion would do this are close to zero. The police, however, led by a shifty-eyed officer (Dan Hedaya, last seen charmingly as President Nixon in DICK), try to pin the crime on Carter by tampering with evidence and witnesses. The full extent of their manipulation becomes apparent as the story advances. When first stopped by the police, Carter just shakes his head. He and another man have just left a party at another bar. ""We're looking for two Negroes in a white car,"" the friendly patrol officer says. ""Any two will do?"" Carter laughingly replies with a tinge of bitter sarcasm. He's been harassed by cops all of his life, but he's the king of the boxing world now and figures he no longer has anything to fear. Still, he resents being harassed. The situation goes from bad to worse when the police haul him into the emergency room. A semi-conscious witness with eyes full of blood is asked again and again whether Carter and his companion were the shooters. Not taking ""no"" for an answer, the cops press on, demanding that the witness give some sign that indicates the answer that they want. In a part of the story that would be laughed off as ridiculously schmaltzy were it not true, four people come to Carter's aid late in his life after he has languished in prison for decades. Although the rich and famous tried to help him earlier, to no avail, three Canadian adults (Deborah Unger, John Hannah, Liev Schreiber) and one Brooklyn ghetto teenager, Lesra (Vicellous Shannon), bravely come to his rescue. The adults, who live together fixing up homes, have temporarily adopted Lesra, a bright kid whom the public schools have failed, in order to get him ready for college. For 25 cents, the first book Lesra ever buys is Carter's. This eventually sends them off on a journey of love and dedication. Rod Steiger, who as the judge du jour seems to appear in every crime drama this year, is finally given the respect he deserves and allowed in this movie to play the part of a judge without parody. The best stories constantly surprise us, which is certainly true of this one. One particularly effective scene has Carter, who prides himself on being a ""warrior scholar,"" talking passionately about the power and magic of writing. Since that is my personal joy, I had this strange feeling that he speaking directly to me. Like one of those paintings in which the eyes follow only you wherever you walk, this movie speaks to each of us and contains many more messages than you might guess. A picture that can be enjoyed and appreciated on many levels, it is a stunning piece of work that deserves high praise and big box office receipts. THE HURRICANE runs 2:30. It is rated R for language and some violence and would be fine for teenagers.

"Babysitter, The",Family,2022,"Well, this is such an underrated movie. I finally saw it for the first time the other day, mainly because I had read so many bad reviews of it. I like to make up my own mind, you should too. I'm really trying to see the point of view of the critics of this movie, and I concede, the overall film quality looks like it's lacking in budget, I don't think that detracts, but really I have to conclude that they didn't like it because they didn't understand it. But enough, on with the review. Alicia Silverstone plays 'The Babysitter', looking after the Tucker's kids while they go out to a cocktail party. Also involved are her boyfriend Jack(Jeremy London) and his manipulative ex-friend Mark(Nikky Katt). Now the point is this, the babysitter (her name is actually Jennifer) is the focus of sexual fantasies by all the males in the film, they dehumanise her and imagine her as a willing participant, whereas in reality she gives them no indication of this. As the situation escalates through drink and bravado, these fantacies start to boil over into reality and finally lead to a climax where Mark is killed by a drink driving Harry Tucker. The situation is a questionable 'was it her fault?' and depending on your own mentality I'm sure you could think that it was. I say absolutley not, but this is the beauty of this movie, the voyeristic way that it is filmed, the way that it invites us into all these fantasies, shows us a mirror to attitudes. All the way through, she is only refered to as 'the babysitter'or 'that girl' or 'your girlfriend', never by her name. Did you even notice? The irony of her repeated question--What were you thinking?-- Is that we know exactly what they were thinking, but what were we thinking? That slut? Poor girl? Show some more flesh, Alicia? The real question is, who do you identify with? The babysitter, the men, or Mrs Tucker? I really think that this is almost a personality test. Whether you like this movie, and essentially, like Alicia in it, depends on who you are. I think that is a huge risk for any film-maker to take. As for Alicia, as the focus of the film, I think that she was great. She wasn't really stretching herself, but this was an early movie and I still haven't seen her struggle with a part. Still she does what she does with great ease, and always with nuances and a subtlety that I really admire.

"Babysitter, The",Family,2022,"Written and directed by Guy Ferland Based on a short story by Robert Coover Starring Alicia Silverstone, Jeremy London, J.T. Walsh Rated R (contains violence, profanity, and brief nudity) 90 minutes Synopsis: A small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend, who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a Friday night. While this is going on, the thug, the father, the boyfriend, and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter. Comments: To say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement. I'm not sure what writer and director Ferland was hoping to accomplish with THE BABYSITTER. Suspense? Family drama? Humor? Erotica? Elements of each of these genres exist in the film, yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them. Instead, THE BABYSITTER is a dull, lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers. I suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing. Alicia Silverstone is completely wasted playing Jennifer, the babysitter. Her character has absolutely no depth at all, and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies. Everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends. The parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds. The father (played by J.T. Walsh) fantasizes about the babysitter; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend. None of these fantasy sequences, trust me, are things that need to be seen, but we see them anyway, complete with cheesy, make-out saxophone music. The thug, in the meantime, proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason. The most absurd character, however, is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead. The thug, in a manipulative, Iago-like manner (though he doesn't really need to try hard), manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking, smoking grass, running away from cops, and playing Peeping Tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes. Incredible! (Of course, the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was, try not to laugh, to sit in an empty diner and read CATCHER IN THE RYE by J.D. Salinger.) If the goal of THE BABYSITTER was to be suspenseful, then it fails. There are surprisingly few tense moments in this film, and nearly all of them come at the final minute. By that time, however, the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them. No suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception. If the goal of THE BABYSITTER was to be humorous, then it also fails. I found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed, at times, to be played for laughs. If the goal of THE BABYSITTER was to be dramatic, then, once again, it fails. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. Finally, if the goal of THE BABYSITTER was to be titillating (the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on HBO at 2 in the morning), then it fails as well. The dream sequences aren't erotic; they are too brief and, outside of one very short scene, contain no nudity. I can't completely trash this movie. The first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film, and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight. The other 79 minutes, though, are a drag. Silverstone's character, at the end of the movie, turns to her boyfriend and asks ""what were you thinking?"" I asked myself the same question, having spent 99 cents renting this turkey.

"Babysitter, The",Family,2022,"I'm really starting to wonder about Alicia Silverstone. Sure, she is one of the most beautiful creatures on God's green earth (second only to that Movie Critic at LARGE guy), but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in, she always strikes out. The Crush was a slow-moving, predictable piece of fluff. Hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation Alicia had only a minor role in. CLUELESS was an annoying, unfunny waste of time. And people have e-mailed me too, saying CLUELESS is a good movie and that I'm the only one who doesn't like it. One girl said if I'd seen the movie with ""an open mind,"" I would have enjoyed it. Nothing could be further from the truth. I went into the theater expecting to love the movie. The preview looked good and of course I'm crazymadinlove with Alicia, but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny, unlikable characters. Almost everyone I saw the movie with felt the same way. When we were walking out of the theater, one guy (and it wasn't me) yelled out, ""That was the worst f$&#in' movie I've ever seen"" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement.</P> <P> So last night I walked into the video store and saw Alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called The Babysitter. I knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion I'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway. What I got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst Alicia Silverstone movie ever. And you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like.</P> <P> Where to begin in criticizing this movie? The plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier, the writing could have been done (and for all we know it was) by a ten year old, Alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever. There is zero humor, zero suspense, zero drama and zero action, until the last ten minutes, when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence. Zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero. So why does this movie get one star out of me? Well, Alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub. And if it wasn't bubble bath, The Babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features, but you settle for what you can get.</P> <P> Alicia plays a babysitter who's spending Friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party. And of course anyone as beautiful as Alicia automatically spends their Friday nights at home (at least that Movie Critic at LARGE guy does). As the movie trods along, we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies (and probably every male viewer's too). The drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth, her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on Alicia from outside, even the prepubescent boy looks in on Alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath. They even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party. Not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy.</P> <P> At least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the PG-rated. In fact, I could imagine THE BABYSITTER becoming a Cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it. So you can't call it a sex flick. I've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama, comedy, thriller or action, so what do you classify THE BABYSITTER as? Bad.</P> <PRE>-- Visit the Movie Critic at LARGE website at <A HREF=""http://www.missouri.edu/~c667778/movies.html"">http://www.missouri.edu/~c667778/movies.html</A></PRE> <HR><P CLASS=flush><SMALL>The review above was posted to the <A HREF=""news:rec.arts.movies.reviews"">rec.arts.movies.reviews</A> newsgroup (<A HREF=""news:de.rec.film.kritiken"">de.rec.film.kritiken</A> for German reviews).<BR> The Internet Movie Database accepts no responsibility for the contents of the review and has no editorial control.

"Babysitter, The",Family,2022,"Director: Guy Ferland Writer: Guy Ferland (based on a story by Robert Coover) Starring: Alicia Silverstone, Jeremy London, Nicky Katt, J.T. Walsh, Lee Garlington, George Segal Everybody in this film's thinking of Alicia. No, this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the ""Cryin'"" video. This is one of those erotic thrillers, but not like one starring Shannon Whirry or Shannon Tweed. First off, there's zero sex, almost no nudity, and it's not as well-plotted as one of those Tweed flicks. Well, anyway. The ""plot."" Alicia plays, well, the babysitter, who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents (J.T. Walsh and Lee Garlington) go out to a party. The film, trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers, shows every characters' thoughts, except Alicia's. The thing is Alicia's in most of them in most cases, and the thoughts aren't too kosher. First off, there's her boyfriend (Jeremy London, who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in ""Mallrats,"" and is only a notch better here), who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully, played by Nicky Katt from ""subUrbia"" (who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again). They decide they want to crash her babysitting job, looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky. Somethine like that. The film intercuts between the subplots (Alicia babysitting, Nicky and Jeremy, the party) and each characters' thoughts. We get to see Jeremy and Nicky's dreams of doing a little threeway with Alicia, J.T. thinking of coming home to find Alicia naked in the bathtub (she has it all covered up, the little tease), and, worst of all, Lee Garlington dreaming of that hunk, George Segal. It even shows them in bed together. Yea. I SO wanted to see George and Lee Garlington in bed, though I guess I'm used to George after seeing her and Mary Tyler Moore fooling around in ""Flirting With Disaster."" The ending is some kind of big tragedy thing, but come on. Like we care about any of the characters. The only interesting one is Alicia, mainly because she's Alicia, and we mostly see her in the fantasies. So I guess she's some kind of mystery or something. But she is never explored further. So, basically, this film is just a series of mastabatory images, sometimes featuring a non-nude Alicia (once again, sadly), sometimes featuring a scantily-clad George Segal (once again, sadly). I watched this on one of those free previews of Showtime or Cinemax one night, and let me tell you, it is the only way to watch this film. I mean, there's a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night: they're just as good as sleeping pills. And this one is one big fat waste of time, even for an Alicia film.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"http://www.speakers-podium.com/susangranger. Susan Granger's review of ""WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM'"" (Fox Searchlight Pictures) Without doubt, Shakespeare is the most sought-after screenwriter in Hollywood. And why not? The game-playing of his characters and their efforts to grapple with reason and love seem quite contemporary, and Shakespeare neither contests re-writes nor demands royalties. Writer/director Michael Hoffman's clever adaptation of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is set in Tuscany around 1900, coinciding with the advent of the bicycle. The plot deals with love in all of its comical and fantastical forms, complicated by fairy jealousy, love potions, and misbegotten romances. The wondrous evening begins with Duke Theseus' involvement in a dispute involving Hermia who loves Lysander but is being forced to marry Demetrius, who is adored by Helena. In the forest, there are five amateur thespians rehearsing ""Pyramus and Thisbe,"" plus the love game between Oberon and Titania, the King and Queen of the Fairies, complicated by the trickster sprite Puck. There have been at least six film versions of this 400 year-old play, including one with 11 year-old Mickey Rooney as Puck, but this vibrant, all-star cast dazzles, particularly Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeifferand Stanley Tucci. Curiously, Calista Flockhart transforms the obsessed Helena into another version of her whining but spunky Ally McBeal character; her mud-wrestling scene with Anna Friel, complete with clinging, wet clothes could only be called bizarre. ""What fools these mortals be!"" On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'"" is a mischievous, whimsical 9. It's a charming, frothy frolic that captures the enchantment and delight of Shakespeare's most magical comedy.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (PG). (Twentieth Century Fox) Director: Michael Hoffman Stars: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christian Bale, Calista Flockhart, Stanley Tucci, Rupert Everett, Dominic West, Anna Friel, Sophie Marceau, David Strathairn, Sam Rockwell, Roger Rees Running time: 121 minutes. To see, or not to see? That is indeed the question regarding Michael Hoffman's rather disappointing and pedestrian adaptation of Shakespeare's whimsical comedy about romance, mismatched lovers and a little night magic. Unlike other directors, such as Baz Luhrmann and his brilliant contemporary version of Romeo And Juliet, Hoffman doesn't take any creative risks with the material, which results in a workmanlike production. The only real change Hoffman makes is in updating the play and relocating it to Tuscany, at the end of the 19th century. It's a change that doesn't add much dramatically to the film, but it does enable a number of the central characters to ride around on ""that new fangled invention"", the bicycle. Hermia (Anna Friel) is engaged to the handsome Demetrius (Christian Bale), a match that pleases her straight laced father (David Strathairn). However, Hermia really loves Lysander (Dominic West), who comes from a lesser background. Meanwhile, Helena (Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart) actually loves Demetrius, but he barely acknowledges her presence. These four lovers wander into the nearby forest, which is the home of the fairy king Oberon (Rupert Everett). They eventually fall under a magical spell cast by the mischievous Puck (Stanley Tucci), which helps the four mismatched lovers solve their problems. Also caught up in one of Puck's spells is Bottom (Kevin Kline), an egotistical actor with an amateur theatrical company which is rehearsing a play in the woods. Hoffman's pacing is rather laboured, and the film offers precious few laughs until the final twenty minutes or so. It is only with the staging of the play within a play sequence that things really pick up, and some much needed life is injected into the film. Visually, the film is quite beautiful, and Oliver Stapleton's typically lush cinematography of the Tuscan countryside is a major plus. The performances of the solid ensemble cast are mostly workmanlike throughout, with most of the performers reciting their lines without much passion or conviction. Kline is wonderful and brings some energy to his role as the pompous and bombastic Bottom, while the always solid Tucci shines as the mischievous Puck. Shakespeare's comedy has been filmed before, most notably in Warner Bros' impressive 1935 version featuring an all star cast headed by James Cagney, making this pale and uninspired adaptation almost unnecessary.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream * * (out of * * * * ) Directed by Michael Hoffman. Cast: Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Christian Bale, Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer, Anna Friel, Dominic West, David Strathairn, Sophie Marceau, Sam Rockwell. 1999 - 121 minutes Rated PG-13 (for brief nudity). Reviewed May 15, 1999. ""Hamlet,"" ""Othello,"" ""Romeo & Juliet,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing."" In the past several years a big screen adaptation of one of William Shakespeare's plays has been released at least every couple months, and with the huge success of Oscar-winner ""Shakespeare in Love,"" many more adaptations are in the works, and the first out the gate is one of his lighter, fluffier comedies, the self-proclaimed ""William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" which, unfortunately, is not nearly as magical as the lovely title implies. The setting of this latest adaptation, directed by Michael Hoffman, has been transported from 17th-century England to 19th-century Tuscany, but strangely enough, the Elizabethan dialogue remains (although, in hindsight, this isn't as ridiculous a thought as 1996's ""Romeo & Juliet,"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes reciting Shakespeare amidst an urban 1990s setting). The fantastical story goes like this: Helena (Calista Flockhart), a disspirited young woman who is head-over-heels in love with Demetrius (Christian Bales), the planned suitor of the beautiful Hermia (Anna Friel), who herself is in love with Lysander (Dominic West), follows each of them into the forest one midsummer's night on her bicycle (a new invention), determined to steal Demetrius' heart. Things don't go quite as planned, however, when they unwittingly step into the forest of the fairies, headed by Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer) and King Oberon (Rupert Everett). Oberon seeks the aid of his horned assistant, Puck (Stanley Tucci), to collect a few red flowers whose juices have the power to turn each person who comes physically into contact with it to fall in love with the first person they see upon waking. So as both Demetrius and Lysander are put under the spell, both of which set their sights on Helena, who simply believes they are playing a cruel trick on her, an overacting troupe member who has come into the forest to practice his latest play finds himself turned into a donkey when he slips on a magic hat, and lusted after by Titania, who has also fallen under the flower's potion. ""William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream"" falls under one of the major shortcomings of all of Shakespeare's works, which is that he wrote tons and tons of carefully planned and intricate dialogue, but always failed at developing his characters, who remained at a distance from the material and were written in a general and vague manner. Aside from perhaps his 'Romeo & Juliet,"" none of his many plays I have read have gotten me to care even remotely about any of the characters, or even the story. To me, the Elizabethan dialogue always felt like a mere gimmick to be flashy, and this film version of ""Midsummer"" is no different. Not at any time during the film did I ever really feel willing to get involved in what was happening on-screen, and the romantic plights of the characters are so thinly written that it is impossible to care about them. If anything, ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a lighthearted fantasy, and with such a bewitching title, those exact sequences set in the forest were the most dull and lifeless, without even a hint of enchantment. Much of the problem goes to the major technical problems, including surprisingly atrocious cinematography by Oliver Stapleton, who overlights ever night scene to such an extent that it often was confusing to whether it had changed to the daytime or not. The last time I was out in the woods during the middle of the night, I couldn't see a thing, but in this movie, there seems to be a constant bright sun shining down on everyone, despite the dark skies. The qualms don't stop there, as the production design by Luciana Arrighi is thoroughly artificial and distracting, never once looking like anything but an extravagant movie set in the confines of a large studio. In one scene, Puck rides into view on a giant turtle that is so fake-looking and obviously mechanical that I felt as if I was watching a movie from the '60s or '70s. All of these problems within the main section of the film, mixed in with the overall amateurish performances, had me actually longing, instead, for the infinitely superior 1982 Woody Allen farce, ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,"" which was funny, whimsical, and involving, three things this current film is sorely lacking. Acting-wise, the performances are all over the map. Faring best is Calista Flockhart (vanquishing her ""Ally McBeal"" character), who seems to understand the difficult dialogue so well that each word that comes out of her mouth is instantly accessible to understand. Flockhart's Helena is also the only character I gave one iota about, as she is a frustrated and unhappy woman who feels like she belongs to Demetrius, even though he doesn't care about her. Kevin Kline is sometimes winning, and at other times downright annoying, as the dim-witted Bottom. Finally, Stanley Tucci makes somewhat of an impression and is well-cast as the sprightly Puck, but what is his exact purpose in the movie other than to narrate the conclusion? On the opposite side of the spectrum is Michelle Pfeiffer's dismal performance as Titania. Pfeiffer is a fine actress, but Shakespearean she's not, as she recites her lines without any thought, energy, or feeling. In a recent interview, Pfeiffer mentioned how she didn't care for Shakespeare, and since she obviously doesn't know how to hold her own against her fellow thespian, it leaves you wondering just why she took this role in the first place. Rupert Everett, an exciting actor so wonderful in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" is given nothing to do here but show off his body, and without any motivation or purpose (aside from setting the whole story into motion), his fairy character comes off as more of an afterthought. And Christian Bale has to be the most largely sought-after bore in the history of film. I don't know; maybe Helena was having a slight bout of insomnia and though that going out with him would cure her, er, problem. The various romantic couplings during the long midsummer night leads not to an enjoyable conclusion (although it has a false one), but unwisely goes on for another twenty minutes with Bottom and company throwing a play of ""Pyrimus and Thisby."" What is supposed to be a charming, humorous sequence is actually a situation we've seen so many times before that it is not funny, only juvenile. Regardless of my many, many criticisms, I did not hate ""William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream."" I hasten to add I didn't like hardly any of it at all, but it wasn't dispicable in the way that ""Armageddon"" or the recent ""The Mummy"" are. Director Michael Hoffman has made a respectable attempt at turning yet another Shakespeare play into a treasured motion picture, but ultimately fails to bring any sort of magic to the story or situations. If you hadn't already realized, ""magic"" was the one thing this movie desperately needed. - Copyright 1999 by Dustin Putman Http://hometown.aol.com/FilmFan16/index.html The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"rated PG-13 starring Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, Dominic West, David Strathairn, Sophie Marceau based on the play by William Shakespeare written and directed by Michael Hoffman There really is no need for me to mention it, but Shakespeare is hotter than ever. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE won Best Picture, and more than a few teen movies are using the Bard as inspiration. We knew it wouldn't be long before we had another period piece Shakespeare adaptation. The film is Michael Hoffman's rich, opulent adaptation of WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. This version of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM moves the setting to Italy towards the end of the 19th century. It is the story of one night when all sorts of unexpected twists occur involving a few couples falling in and out of love. Demetrius(Christian Bale), is set to be wed to Hermia(Anna Friel), who actually is in love with Lysander(Dominic West). Since Hermia doesn't want to be forced into unwanted wedlock, she runs away into the forest with Lysander. But that is not before they tell Helena(Calista Flockhart), who is starved for Demetrius' affection, of their plans. Helena then tells Demetrius of their flight, and he rushes into the forest, followed by Helena. It is there that all four of them encounter Puck(Stanley Tucci), a fairy who administers a love potion that will make a person fall in love with the next person he sees. Puck also works his magic on the fairy queen(Michelle Pfeiffer), who falls in love with an actor(Kevin Kline) who is turned into a donkey, while the fairy king(Rupert Everett) makes some observations of his own. Michael Hoffman(ONE FINE DAY, RESTORATION) works wonders with a superb ensemble cast; the standouts being Pfeiffer, Kline, and Calista Flockhart, who takes a step away from ""Ally McBeal"". The film is shot wondrously on location by Oliver Stapleton(THE GRIFTERS, ONE FINE DAY), who makes the play seem anything but stagy. A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a fine film, but if there is a problem to be mentioned, it is the film's length. At 115 minutes, the movie is too long to just be taken as a light comedy, and there isn't much in the way of drama to hold a viewer's attention. Although I am unfamiliar with the play, there doesn't seem to be much original work added to this production, despite the change in location. But all in all, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a funny, lush tribute to the Bard's greatness...and newfound popularity. a review by Akiva Gottlieb, The Teenage Movie Critic akiva@excite.com http://www.angelfire.com/mo/film watch me on TBS' ""Dinner And A Movie"" May 21, 8:05pm EST Get your free, private email at http://mail.excite.com/ The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"After the incredible and unexpected success of ""Shakespeare in Love"", the audience has again opened their eyes for Shakespeare. Michael Hoffman is one of many that dived into the ocean of Shakespeare's poetry during the last decade. ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" has been adapted to the big screen several times, with no particular luck. It can be a dark nightmare, a slapstick comedy, or a semi-serious melodrama, depending on the script adaptation. Hoffman has chosen the most common and easiest way - light comedy. The director creates an enchanting atmosphere, as he brings to the foreground of the story beauty and elegance - a magical recipe for the recreation of a timeless story that is as relevant today as it was when Shakespeare wrote it. Hoffman didn't move too far away from Shakespeare's original play: Egeus, father to Hermia, has betrothed his daughter to Demetrius, a man who in turn loves her with all his heart, and is determined not to let Hermia's true love, Lysander, from inheriting his bride. Then Hermia and Lysander plot to run away together to avoid this marriage, and even possible death. They share their plot with Helena, a close friend, who unfolds on-stage her own attraction to Demetrius. She then storms out to inform him of what Hermia and Lysander are doing, which will benefit Helena later, as she suspects that her decision to reveal this plan to Demetrius will show him how much she loves him. The parallel story unfolds in the forest nearby, where magic transforms the grounds into an enchanted parallel world. Here we meet the fairies. Oberon (Rupert Everett) and Titania (Michele Pfeiffer ) are king and queen of this charming race, but that does not prevent them from feuding over an Indian boy Titania cares for. Returning home and falling asleep, Oberon discusses a plot with his servant, Puck, to apply a nectar from a forest flower to his queen's eyes so that, when she awakes, she shall fall in love with the first ugly creature that catches her eye. Continuing with this plan, the king hears the accounts of the four lovers as they become separated from each other in the forest. He furthers his orders to Puck, who is instructed to apply this nectar to Demetrius, so that he can fall in love with Helena, and all will be solved. But the plan is distracted when Puck gets the men confused, and applies the nectar to Lysander's eyes. He then exits the scene, and Lysander, as you probably know, falls in love with Helena at first sight. Before the dawn all of Puck's mistakes have been corrected, the magic is gone, the madness ends and the right lovers fall in love with the people they are supposed to. With his 1996 production of ""Hamlet"", Kenneth Branagh showed that it is possible to conceive a brilliant adaptation of the full text, but the result will have a long running time, which would be unfortunate for a film like ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". Hoffman has chosen a more traditional approach of snipping speeches by removing ""extraneous"" material. He is less successful. Because of the minor problems in the script and unusually rare and difficult language the acting feels at times cold and removed, as if the actors themselves didn't quite understand the lines they are pronouncing. Christian Bale is pale, Calista Flockheart and Anna Friel are acceptable and Dominic West is at times interesting. But it is only Kevin Cline, Stanley Tucci and Michelle Pfieffer that feel confortable in their roles and really give extraordinary performances. Hoffman's magical picture relies more on performances and atmosphere than on special effects and depth of story. There are no computerized creatures and characters, which is a nice break from Lucas and Besson. The technically simple, but incredibly effective art/set direction dazzle the viewer with golden sparks and fairies, shining in the air like gems, and silver moonlight shining upon our lovers. Makeup and costume design are spectacular in creating a variety of odd denizens, including a rather frightening- looki ng medusa and a few alien-looking creatures. The movie captures the delicate beauty of this Shakespearean comedy. In a magical fantasy setting like this, lines as ""The course of true love never did run smooth"" and ""Lord, what fools these mortals be"" work exceptionally well. The director changed setting from 16th century Greece to Tuscany in the late 1800s. The bicycle  a relatively new invention at the time  becomes a key prop, allowing characters to pedal after each other instead of chasing around on foot. It also provides one of the movie's most amusing sight gags. But he is careful, this is not ""Romeo + Julia"". The modernizations aren't too modern, and his changes to the original story are minor and almost unnoticeable. We have had many spectacular adaptations of Shakespeare's undying masterpieces. And it is a tuff task to compare with them. Michael Hoffman's new feature doesn't capture the depth and grandness of Kenneth Brannagh's ""Hamlet"", nor does it possess the power and originality of Richard Loncrane's ""Richard III"" . But its magical beauty and appealing plot make it good enough to stand in such exceptional company.---------------------------------------------- The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (director: Michael Hoffman; cast: Kevin Kline (Nick Bottom), Michelle Pfeiffer (Titania), Rupert Everett (Oberon), Stanley Tucci (Puck), Calista Flockhart (Helena), Anna Friel (Hermia), Christian Bale (Demetrius), Dominic West (Lysander), David Strathairn (Theuseus), SophieMarceau (Hippolyta), Roger Rees (Peter Quince), Max Wright (Robin Starveling), Gregory Jbara (Snug), Bill Irwin (Tom Snout), Sam Rockwell (Francis Flute), Bernard Hill (Egeus), 1999) Shakespeare's lightweight farce is transported from 16th century Greece to 19th century Tuscany (there are now bicycles with headlights to shine in the night and wonderful operatic interludes). The plot revolves around the upcoming wedding of Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) and Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau). Problems arise when a forced marriage between Hermia (Friel) and Demetrius (Bale) is proposed by Hermia's father, even though Hermia is in love with Lysander (West), and Helena (Calista) is madly in love with Demetrius. Another subplot has to do with the group of would-be thespians who are asked to perform at the duke's wedding, led by the weaver Nick Bottom (Kline). His over-the-top performance is amusingly brilliant, as when he turns into an ass and woos a beautiful queen, and when he emotes from that junior high school type of play, ""Pyramus and Thisby,"" that he is asked to perform at the wedding. He ends up stealing the film with his energetic comical rendition of a buffoon.This character has always been considered one of Shakespeare's best comedy roles. The fun and heart of the story takes place with one overnight trip into the woods, where the unrelenting lovers travel to in their planned elopement. The fun part begins when these mortals run unbeknownst to them into the ever-playful Puck (Tucci), the servant of Oberon, who sprinkles into their eyes a love potion that lures them into loving the first person they see. Love in this fairyland setting has more to do with chance than anything else since it is blind. The mix-ups that follow Puck's interference, create new difficulties and allow for the lovers to be manipulated and mismatched by Puck's magic. He even fools the beautiful Fairy Queen Titania (Pfeiffer) into falling in love with the transformed Bottom, now appearing as an ass, even though her true love is the handsome Fairy King Oberon (Rupert). Shakespeare's magic wasn't working; and, I think that was because an hour or so of the play's dialogue was lopped off, making this three hour play into a two hour movie. The consequences are that the characters couldn't be fully developed; in fact, the film had a flatness to it that belied how good its lush cinematography made it look. Instead of character development, we got rolls in the mud to convey the deep feelings of how the young lovers felt about the confusion Puck's love potions had on them. Too dumb down Shakespeare even further, there were times when the director used obvious facial gestures by the characters to let us in on how to react to what they were doing. This is sort of like the canned responses for those tv shows, where a sign is held up to let the audience know when to applaud. What was eloquent about the film, that made it a passable viewing experience, was due to the superb cast, a mixture of true Shakespearian British actors; such as, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, and Dominic West, and the feisty non-Shakespearian actors, Calista Flockhart, Stanley Tucci, Rupert Everett and Michelle Pfeiffer.Then there was the stirring use of Verdi's greatest operatic hits throughout the film, which fitted conveniently in with the director's 19th century Italian theme. This is a clever film; it is much better than the scores of amateur stage productions that continually flood the country. But the director made a lot of odd choices in this film that take away somewhat from the magical feeling of the play and make it seem artificial, or more of a commercial venture than it should be. There was no artistic reason to be in 19th century Italy, except for its rich landscapes and colorful costumes and beautiful villas shown. Also, the flatness and clumsiness of the fairyland scenes when juxtaposed against the lively actor's troupe, made this film seem uneven, even begging us to utter with conviction the bard's choice words: ""What fools these mortals be.""

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"STARRING: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Christian Bale, Anna Friel, David Strathairn, Sophie Marceau, Dominic West DIRECTOR: Michael Hoffman WRITTEN BY: Michael Hoffman William Shakespeare has been dead for almost 400 years now, but his plays are truly immortal as a source of entertainment-- not to mention trepidation for young English students. His colleague Ben Jonson (in one of whose plays Shakespeare acted) wrote, ""He is not of an age, but for all time."" The recent trend for film directors has been to put that theory to the test by setting the Bard's tales in entirely different historical eras, but leaving the dialogue intact. In 1996, Australian director Baz Luhrmann transplanted Romeo and Juliet into modern-day Verona Beach, complete with guns, gangs, and Leo. This year, Michael Hoffman (One Fine Day, Restoration) takes Shakespeare's early comedy, changes the milieu from ancient Greece to 19th-century Tuscany, and throws in a few bicycles for good measure. These conceits aside, there are some good moments in the film, thanks to thoughtful set design and engaging performances by Everett as Oberon and Tucci as the, er, puckish Robin Goodfellow. If you want to know how the plot of this thing unfolds, read the frickin' play, because it's pretty convoluted. Let's just say it involves a love triangle complicated by political intrigue, an attempted elopement by night, a female stalker, a troupe of low-rent actors, and a jealous fairy king whose schemes cause the sort of multi-layered misunderstandings that would go on to inspire any number of Three's Company episodes. It's a comedy, though, so everything turns out happily in the end. In the wrong hands, such exquisitely mannered stuff can be either stultifying or just silly. The actors have to understand it deeply enough to make it accessible to the audience, yet also utter the lines as though they'd never been spoken before. After 400 years, both requirements are tougher than ever, but some of this cast pull it off. Rupert Everett (My Best Friend's Wedding) in particular, with his brooding, English handsomeness, brings the fairy king Oberon to life with equal parts bitterness and mischievousness. As Puck, Oberon's underling and errand boy, Stanley Tucci (Big Night) also demonstrates an easy facility with the Bard's turn of phrase. When he bemusedly says ""What fools these mortals be,"" it seems so natural that it takes a second to register that he's just uttered one of the most famous quotes in all of Shakespeare. Together, the two actors give their characters a depth of mutual familiarity one would expect from immortals. Michelle Pfeiffer, for her part, is a beautiful (if strangely virginal) Titania, and Kevin Kline has great fun making an ass of himself as the aptly named Bottom. Less successful are David Strathairn and Calista Flockhart. Strathairn, whose Theseus sounds like something out of a high school drama class, should have been reminded that it's okay to break the iambic pentameter rhythm. As the lovelorn Helena, Flockhart tries too hard, with too much Ally McBeal melodrama, and thus fails to convince. With all these characters (and more) flitting from scene to scene, Hoffman and production designer Luciana Arrighi wisely chose to create a small but effective forest set rather than film on location. It's stagy, but that's the idea; it allows for an Elizabethan intimacy, but still looks wild enough to harbor sprites and nymphs and such. This latter aspect also heightens the film's sensuality, both in the scenes involving Lysander and Hermia and in Titania's languid pillow talk with Bottom. Backed up by special effects which for once aren't intrusive, it's a cozy environment that never steals attention from the actors. The film tends to drag at first, but picks up the pace by the third act and finishes strongly with the troupe's hilarious production of ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" and the all's-well resolution. While Hoffman's more modern setting doesn't really matter, he makes it work without awkwardness, and he restrains his directorial caprice enough to leave the writer's dialogue alone. By the time Puck finishes his final whimsical disclaimer, that dreaded 400-year-old ghost of English class past won't seem so bad after all.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"Director: Michael Hoffman Cast: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Dominic West, Christian Bale Screenplay: Michael Hoffman Producers: Michael Hoffman, Leslie Urdang Runtime: US Distribution: 20th Century Fox Rated PG-13: sensuality, nudity Copyright 1999 Nathaniel R. Atcheson I've always been sort of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare. I think it is possible to update his plays and place them in a period of time in which they were not intended to be set. But this is not an easy thing to do. Those who have seen William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet have experienced the ultimate failure in an update of a Shakespeare play. Michael Hoffman's A Midsummer Night's Dream is much better than that other movie, and I was thisclose to giving it a favorable review. And while I have nice things to say about it, the film just doesn't work the way it should. The first reason for this, perhaps, is that it's set at the turn of the 19th century for no reason whatsoever. It's also an artistically confusing film: why do all the sets look so obviously fake? Why do the actors feature an array of non-matching accents? Why do so many of the scenes occur in the exact same spot of woods? These are questions I had when I should have been concentrating on Shakespeare's brilliantly-conceived story. But I have to give Hoffman credit for following the play so closely. >From what I could tell, no scenes have been removed, and only parts of speeches have been trimmed down. Other than that, Hoffman has done the source material justice with his script. The story is a familiar one: The four lovers, Demetrius (Christian Bale), Lysander (Dominic West), Helena (Calista Flockhart), and Hermia (Anna Friel), are manipulated relentlessly by Puck (Stanley Tucci) and Oberon, the Fairy King (I stand by my belief that Rupert Everett has this role as part of a Hollywood in-joke). Meanwhile, the lovable lout Bottom (Kevin Kline) and his partners in stupidity work to put together a lame stage version of Pyramus and Thisbe. The basic set-up of the film lends itself to a series of entertaining and/or tedious scenes in which lovers run around and shout at each other in a forest near Athens. The film is a mixed bag of scenes that are notably over-the-top and others that are strangely perfunctory. The best scene in the film is the last one, in which the six lower classmen get to perform their play before the aristocracy. Here, Kevin Kline shows off his well-established comic brilliance. But Hoffman's direction of the scene is really what carries it, as the players make desperate attempts to impersonate walls, moons, and lions. The other high points of the film lie mostly in a few key performances. Calista Flockhart is quite funny as the love-starved and ravished Helena; even though Flockhart doesn't attempt a British accent, she enunciates properly and does a good job with her lines. Everett takes an interesting angle on Oberon, playing him as stone-faced and extremely pensive. And Stanley Tucci makes a perfectly indifferent Puck, roaming around the forest and making people fall in love with each other just because it's amusing. Many scenes are great, and they add up to a lot, but there are too many failed moments to ignore. Michelle Pfeiffer annoyed me, playing Queen Titania as some sort of breathless, shiny-eyed nymph; I disliked most of her scenes, and particularly the tedious ones in which she falls for Bottom following his transformation into an ass. David Strathairn entirely misses the point of the paradoxical Theseus, and delivers his lines with a cold, inappropriate American accent. Hoffman also missed the boat with Bottom and his crew; they're not nearly silly or stupid enough, and scenes that are hilarious in the text come across as detached and obligatory here. Shakespeare makes explicit their misusage of words and their inability to understand the point of drama, but here Hoffman seems to blow right past all the jokes. In general, I don't understand why the movie looks so flashy and fake. The forest of Arden looks particularly set-like, and pointless special effects (like a CGI vine wrapping around Bottom's feet) call too much attention to themselves. I realize that live theater does not allow for fancy special effects and sets, but films do, and a film version of a play should not be made to look fake. And then there's the needless time period-change, which bothers me every time a director attempts it: people didn't speak like this at the turn of the 19th century. Hoffman's A Midsummer Night's Dream works on many levels -- nothing could be as bad as that other movie -- but it doesn't go far enough with some themes, and takes others way too far. I think it all boils down to a general lack of consistency -- what was Hoffman's vision? What's with the fake sets and the half-hearted ""update?"" There are big laughs to be had in this film, but Hoffman's puzzling artistic choices keep it from being the really good update of a Shakespeare play that it might have been.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"Starring Christian Bale, Rupert Everett, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Kevin Kline, Michael Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci, and Dominic West. Directed by Michael Hoffman. Written by Michael Hoffman, play by William Shakespeare. `Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire...' When A Midsummer Night's Dream is done well, it should take us on a journey to a magical place and time, ignite our imaginations and stir our hearts. When Shakespeare is done well, the language and emotion must flow out of every actor, making us understand even if we don't quite follow every turn of phrase. Michael Hoffman's film does all this and more. It is beautifully done and, for the most part, wonderfully acted. This is what theater brought to the screen should be. Clearly an Oscar contender for costume and set design, this version has been placed convincingly in the 1900s (and out of ancient Greece), a trick which only jars occasionally and allows our heroes and heroines to amusingly rush through the woods on bicycles. The fairy kingdom is enchanting, and the whole production shines with the time and care that was obviously put into it. There are several notable performances, including Kevin Kline in a standout portrayal of Bottom, the acting enthusiast who wants to take on every part in the play within the play, and Rupert Everett as a dark and sexy Oberion, the fairy king, while the ever vivacious Stanley Tucci seems to be having the time of his life playing his faithful servant Puck. As for the women, the best performance is clearly held by Calista Flockhart in the frequently less-than-desirable role of Helena, who spends the entire play throwing herself at the reluctant Demetrius, played by Christian Bale. Flockhart brings humor and sympathy to her Helena. For in typical Shakespearian comedy style, Demetrius is love with Hermia (Anna Friel), who is turn in love with Lysander (Dominic West), who is thankfully in love with her (Hermia). At least most of the time. My least favorite performance was surprisingly that of Michelle Pfeiffer, who is absolutely radiant and gives a good performance, but somehow comes off as rather unbelievable as the fairy queen to Everett's Oberion. Other less than perfect moments include a glimpse of the child she's adopted, who for some reason is very blue. OK, he's from India, but he's `mortal born,' and it struck me as odd. He's very blue. Also, there's a mud wrestling scene that I could have done without. I found myself overly distracted from the dialogue. Luckily, our heroes and heroines lose the mud very quickly. Must be that fairy magic. What is most outstanding is the wonderful interpretation of Shakespeare's work. Many of the things one familiar with the play would expect and hope to be there, are. However, there are also many surprises and interesting interpretations of lines and situations. For when all is said and done, this is Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, a play in which it is sometimes hard to keep up the pace as it shifts back and forth between the multiple story lines. And yet, fascination and love of this play persists, and people love to perform and watch it over and over again. It's hard to imagine someone doing another film version after this one, but someone will. As Puck might say, `Lord, what fools these mortals be!' Ah but Puck... perhaps not. We can all use a little fairy magic now and again. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"Have you ever had one of those dreams where things don't quite work the way they should, where stuff happens out of context and in the wrong places and the people don't all fit, but you still wake up feeling pretty good? That's the way it is with Michael (""Soapdish"") Hoffman's take on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This is one of those conceptually reimagined Shakespearean productions, and while such adventures can work (Ian McKellan's ""Richard III""), they run the risk of throwing the proceedings out of balance, and that's what happens here. Hoffman has set his version of the Bard's Athenian comedy in Tuscany, which causes a few problems, and he's updated it to the late 19th century (presumably to be able to throw in bicycles), which causes a few more. References to Athens seem a little strange in the setting, and a hundred years ago they were letting girls play girls' parts, which strains the logic of the ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" play-within-a-play casting. The first clue that something may be amiss comes at the main title, which is overlaid with a wink-and-nudge note to the effect that corsets and high-button collars were still in fashion, but ""the good news is that the bustle was on its way out, which made possible the use of that new-fangled invention, the bicycle."" This doesn't set a Shakespearean tone, but it seems to embolden Hoffman to make a few other improvements on Shakespeare as he rolls along. The worst of these is a digression where, to give more prominence and pathos to Bottom, he has rude workmen spill red wine on the weaver's white suit, and then sends him home crestfallen to his apartment and his harridan wife (whom we've seen earlier looking for him and demanding in Italian ""Where's that worthless husband of mine?"") It becomes a virtual subplot, and it's of no great help to Shakespeare. But the source material is magnificent, and the settings are beautiful, and the cast for the most part is up to the challenge. Dominic West as Lysander falls the shortest, but Calista Flockhart is a revelation as Hermia, and Stanley Tucci makes Puck a rascally animated cartoon that nicely fits the sprightly character. Rupert Everett is good as a quietly scheming Oberon, and Michelle Pfeiffer's beauty and talent do lovely things with Titania, though she occasionally seems to lose confidence and resort to acting flourishes. The outstanding performance belongs to Kevin Kline, whose Bottom the Weaver radiates a rustic goodness and balances buffoonery with simple wisdom. Kline's language is effortless, his timing flawless, and his depth bottomless. He and Sam Rockwell (as the boy Thisbe) make a hilarious romp of the climactic play-within-a-play, which features that current comedy staple, the hurled dog, and might be retitled ""There's Something About Thisbe"". The bottom line: despite its many flaws, it's still ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", and it's still well worth seeing.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"*** (out of 4) I'll start the film review with points against, because by criticizing at the start (and since the criticisms are but small) we put behind us things unpleasant, which, though necessary if one wants to share the truth, do not comprise the all of one's experience watching Hoffman's film. This version of A Midsummer Night's Dream at 19th century's turn's suppos'dly set (though ""turn"" in this case surely means the last, for phonographs in 1800 would be out of place). But let's not fret o'er when it's set; suffice to say that it was long ago. The setting isn't modern like the one Baz Luhrmann used when he made Romeo + Juliet some two or three years past. Nor is the setting bold and striking like McKellen and Loncraine's Richard III which looks and feels like Nazi Germany (it's chilling to the bone and worth a rent.) The point is that this film does not have one odd thing about it, leading one to ask: ""Why now? Why film? Why not a trav'ling play?"" Effects most special? Not particul'y (although the fairies made of light are neat). Amazing sound and music? Not to me. (although I think the music rang a bell) I guess that Hoffman simply wished to tell a lightweight tale for summer moviegoers. ""Lightweight"" describes the film most fittingly, unless perhaps you know of what I speak when I say ""fluff."" But ""fluff"" is not the worst of jibes; in fact a very pleasant time is eas'ly had at movies which are fluff. In short: it's nothing special and it's fluff, and that was it. That's all the bad I had to say about this film. (Espesh'ly since I thought I wouldn't mention the first scene with Michelle Pfeiffer -- her deliv'ry was not great and sounded wooden. But, quite soon the feeling passed and so I thought I'd leave those unkind words unwritten in my piece). At this point in reviews I often find it's time to summarize the movie's plot, but this time I will not. For since the film's retelling is quite faithful, I'll not bore you with the details -- you can always look them up in any tome of Shakespeare's work. (In fact there's even now a ""dummies"" book!) The changes Hoffman made, (he wrote the script as well), it seems to me were mostly made to make the dialogue seem more like speech and less like speeches. Shakespeare's words and deeds were left intact as far as I can tell. Okay, a little -- little! -- summary to save you looking up the movie's plots. (I say instead of ""plot,"" the plural. Yes, this film has two threads, prob'ly more, but I'll just keep my myself to two, for breviphiles.) The first one is a love triangle, but it is a square, because it has four sides: Fair Helena fawns o'er Demetrius, who loves her not; for he loves Hermia. In fact, he'll marry her, though not because she loves him back. Tis father's whim to whom she'll wed; and he doth pick Demetrius. But Hermia loves good Lysander, and he requites her love, which means that of the four sides to our square, just Helena's unloved. The other thread tells of the fairy king and how his plot to tease his wife ensnares a simple weaver/actor by the name of Bottom. (He's the one, and this the play, where human head turns into ass's head.) That's all the summary you'll get from me. There's more, but tis of no immense import. The film deserves some praise, now that we've moved beyond the summary and criticism, And most of it belongs to Hoffman's cast: a fine job all around and in all roles. Though Kevin Kline (as Bottom) gets the first screen credit at the end, the credits at the film's beginning show the players' names in alphabetic order. In that way ensemble acting's emphasized o'er ""stars"" or egos. Quite refreshing, I do say. Puck (Stanley Tucci), gray and bald, still has a spritely step along with some of Dream's most funny lines. Calista Flockhart shines as our fair Helena, and though comes close, she never whines (a fear that's grounded in her TV past). And Kevin Kline can act the fool in such a charming way that you can love him, foolish mortal though he be. You'll surely recognize the faces of the other actors, even if you don't know what their names may be. Of more import, though, is that all performances are good. Nor Rupert Everett (as the Fairy King -- don't laugh), nor Pfeiffer as his wife are bad, though both of them are flatter than the rest. So all in all A Midsummer Night's Dream is pretty good, considering it's fluff. And if you have a couple hours to spare -- say Star Wars is sold out and you have made no other plans -- see Kline and Tucci play their parts. It may not change your life but for an afternoon you will be entertained. The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"_William_Shakespeare's_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_ (PG-13) *** The assembled talents of an all-star cast are exploited most delightfully in Michael Hoffman's adaptation of _William_Shakespeare's_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_. While as sunny and sweet as the Bard's original romantic comedy of errors, this update isn't always dreamy, but its classic romantic spell should leave moviegoers swooning. The ""dream"" of the title is actually one very real night in the forest where lovers are star-crossed, criss-crossed, or just plain made cross, thanks to the magical machinations of Oberon (Rupert Everett), the King of Fairies; and his impish right-hand sprite, Puck (Stanley Tucci). Into the forest that night come the hopelessly besotted Lysander (Dominic West) and Hermia (Anna Friel), the latter of whom is lovelessly betrothed to Demetrius (Christian Bale), who, in turn, is pursued, however clumsily, by the unloved-by-anyone Helena (Calista Flockhart). A few drops of a flower's magical juice later, and a bewildered Helena finds herself the object of desire for both Demetrius and Lysander, leaving Hermia by the wayside. The juice is indeed loose, for also falling under its power is Oberon's wife Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes enamored of an ass--literally and figuratively. His apt name is Nick Bottom (Kevin Kline), a pompous ham of an actor who is transformed into a half-man/half-donkey monstrosity by a playful Puck. This section, being the part that gives the play its title, is the focal point of the play and the film, but, strangely enough, it's also the part that works the least well in the film. Of course, it has nothing to do with the parent text; Shakespeare's timeless barbs (mostly delivered by a comically cruel Lysander to a disbelieving Hermia) would never lose their edge in any translation. Neither are the actors at fault; they are all up to the Shakespearean task. The biggest revelation is Flockhart, who displays exquisite comic timing as the very un-Ally Helena. What is at fault, is Hoffman's staging, or, rather, his stage. This entire second act was filmed on a soundstage, and it shows: the backdrops are flat; the same tree sets are recycled over and over again; and--most distracting of all--it's ridiculously overlit (it may be midsummer, but it still is _night_). A certain level of unreality should be brought to this section--we are dealing with fairies and man-asses here--but it's one thing to be unreal (as in a fantasy) and entirely another to appear artificial (as in synthetic). Hoffman has better luck with other directorial choices. Most notable is his change of setting from ancient Greece to 19th Century Italy, and this adds a fresh new dimension to the material: fresh locations, fresh costumes (no tights!), and, most notably, the advent of the bicycle, which adds some needed movement to static scenes. Hoffman also doesn't force fake British accents upon his non-Brit stars (Pfeiffer, Flockhart, Kline, Tucci, David Strathairn, and Sophie Marceau), sparing them and the audience a Kevin Costner-as-Robin Hood-type embarrassment that would only distract from the poetry of Shakespeare's words. It is the timeless appeal of those words, the impassioned performances, and a bring-down-the-house third act (in which Bottom and his inept troupe of actors put on a hilariously disastrous play) that make this high-spirited, if a bit overlong (115 minutes), production live up to its title: a dream indeed--not without its fuzzy areas, but on the whole ""a most rare vision.""

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"With large helpings of Shakespeare being so popular these days, Michael Hoffman has prepared his own cinematic casserole based on one of the Bard's livelier plays, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. (The movie is formally titled WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM to avoid confusion with Tennessee Williams's and other playwrights' versions.) With an established pedigree in lavish costume drama from his respected RESTORATION, Hoffman might seem a natural to cook up something special for viewers. He combines some of Hollywood's finest acting ingredients but comes up with little more than leftover hash. Partially modernizing the drama, Hoffman sets the action in Italy at the turn of the 19th century. The opening credits explain that it was a time when the bustle was on the wane and the bicycle was on the rise, which were compatible trends. This humor is typical of the too-cute-to-be-funny level upon which the movie operates. When the actors, dressed in 19th century costumes, begin to speak the language of Shakespeare, it grates on the nerves like watching John Wayne with Japanese dubbing. The sets are sumptuous, the cinematography handsome, and the operatic music stirring. So long as the actors aren't speaking, the movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, much like RESTORATION. A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM should have you alternately laughing and grinning, but Hoffman's version leaves one staring quizzically, never knowing quite what to make of it. With a killer cast and a great play, he manages to make the poetically beautiful surprisingly bland. Many of the actors shine above the dullness of the direction. Chief among these is Calista Flockhart (""Ally McBeal""), who steals the show as Helena. With bewitching twitching, she flits about the set with unbounded energy and infectious good spirits. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett, as Titania and Oberon, compete in the movie's beauty contest. Pfeiffer, who long ago seems to have located the Fountain of Youth, gets my vote, but Everett is a close second. Neither give especially memorable performances, but looks count for a lot when you have to sit through such a sleep-inducing production. And if you've ever needed a reason to believe in fairies, Pfeiffer, as a fairy, supplies a most convincing argument. Kevin Kline gets to chew up the scenery playing a bad actor named Bottom. He makes an especially convincing ass during one of the fairy sequences. His play within a play at the end, however, is a disaster. It is supposed to be laughably bad but is, instead, merely bad. Stanley Tucci, who seems to enjoy every movie he's in, has a playful, good time as Puck. Hoffman, who also wrote the screen adaptation, makes many strange staging choices; none more so than having Flockhart engage in mud wrestling. Like so much of the movie, this scene is more weird than funny. Given all of the other liberties Hoffman takes with the play, it is a shame that he didn't shortened it more. This version quickly becomes tedious and frequently drags. If he had brought the picture in at an hour and a half, it could only have helped. ""Lord, what fools these mortals be,"" Puck complains. This would be the perfect tagline for this production for it is indeed quite foolishly done. On the other hand, lame Shakespeare is still Shakespeare. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM runs too long at 1:58. It is rated PG-13 for lots of partial nudity usually covered up with strategically placed hair and flowers. The film would be fine for kids around 11 and up.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (Fox Searchlight) Starring: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, Dominic West, David Strathairn, Sophie Marceau. Screenplay: Michael Hoffman, based on the play by William Shakespeare. Producers: Leslie Urdang and Michael Hoffman. Director: Michael Hoffman. MPAA Rating: PG-13 (adult themes, brief nudity) Running Time: 115 minutes. Reviewed by Scott Renshaw. The cinematic cynic in me suspects that the lofty, unwieldy title of WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM has as much to do with timely marketing as it does with a nod to literary fidelity. After all, when adults are flocking to the Oscar-winning SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and teens are catching ""The Taming of the Shrew"" turned into 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, the Bard would seem to be riding a unique wave of cross-demographic hipness. Then again, Shakespeare has always been pitched both at the gallery and at the groundlings, mixing the matters of kings with the matters of clowns. To that extent, this MIDSUMMER NIGHT is truly William Shakespeare's in its mix of disparate elements, with all the delights and potential pitfalls that accompany them. Writer/director Michael Hoffman transports the tale from Greece to 19th century Tuscany, where many plotlines swirl around the impending wedding of Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) and Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau). Hermia (Anna Friel), the daughter of one of Theseus' courtiers, is forcefully engaged to marry Demetrius (Christian Bale), but Hermia instead shares a love with Lysander (Dominic West). Demetrius, meanwhile, is the object of affection of Hermia's childhood friend Helena (Calista Flockhart). Another thread finds a group of amateur actors, led by the weaver Nick Bottom (Kevin Kline), preparing a play to be performed for the Duke's wedding, perhaps to receive an award if it is well-liked. The paths of these characters all cross in the nearby forest, where complications ensue as the machinations of the Fairy King Oberon (Rupert Everett) and his mischievous servant Puck (Stanley Tucci) -- aided by a little love potion -- cause every romantic entaglement to become further entangled. At its most basic level, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a precursor to bedroom farce without the slamming doors (doors being hard to come by in the forest). As the enchanted lovers become a circle of frustration -- Lysander is made to love Helena, who still loves Demetrius, who still loves Hermia, who still loves Lysander -- saucy exchanges alternate with good old-fashioned female mud wrestling. It takes more than a little while for the film to find its pacing, hindered by the atypically awkward work of Strathairn, but once the pleasantly low-tech, stage-set world of the forest becomes the focus, the high and low comedy both begin working. The one major hindrance may be the clash of acting styles: while Bale, Friel and West go for pure Royal Shakespeare, Flockhart plays Helena as a neurotic mess fretting over her appearance a la Ally McBeal. It's an interesting interpretation, but one that doesn't always mesh with the other players. The other major sub-plot becomes both A MIDSUMMER NIGHT DREAM's high point and its source of greatest disappointment. Kevin Kline, turning in one of his better performances, plays Nick Bottom as a wonderfully tragi-comic sadsack, an unhappily married laborer with grand dreams of how the stage will offer him a chance at greatness. When he is simultaneously transformed into an ass and into the object of desire of the love potion-affected Fairy Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), it's touching to note how his moment of glory makes him oblivious to his physical state. Unfortunately, Hoffman doesn't exploit Kline's performance for all it can offer, never really delivering a satisfying resolution to the character he has set up. He does, however, build to a wonderfully comic climax as the actors finally perform their play within the play. The bumbling performance is pure slapstick -- malapropped lines, misaligned props, over-the-top acting and, to quote SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, a bit with a dog. The one nice twist comes as Flute (Sam Rockwell), the actor-in-drag performing the ingenue in the play, breaks from character to deliver an earnest paean to true love. It's a sweet note on which to end a play of sometimes discordant tones, perhaps making this DREAM seem less uneven that it should. The course of this tale about the course of true love never does run smooth; it merely offers a fanciful comedy deserving enough of the author's name.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"Cast: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, Dominic West, David Strathairn, Sophie Marceau. Screenplay: Michael Hoffman, based on the play by William Shakespeare. Producers: Leslie Urdang and Michael Hoffman. Director: Michael Hoffman. For those who have little idea of what this movie is about, it's about Shakespeare. Don't be like the poor gentleman behind me who paid good money for a seat, probably drawn in by names like Pfeiffer and Flockhart, only to be disappointed that they are speaking in a different language. That's right. It takes a good fifteen to twenty minutes for the human brain to comprehend that this is actually English - the smarter, more poetic sort. But once the brain has rearranged several pathways of functioning, Shakespeare becomes understandable and that's when you begin to realise, what a truly great artist he was. Problems  the setting, the costumes and the actors all seem slightly out of place neither looking Greek, or as if the names Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander truly belong to them. Humour. Lots of naked butts and sex references. The grade six kids who were sent in by their parents, no doubt for the educational experience, ended up giggling whenever bare flesh flashed their way. Shakespeare was no doubt ahead of his time. The Fairy Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer) gets laid by an Ass (not arse), and when her husband Oberon finally breaks the spell (in forgiveness), they get laid next to the Ass. This says a lot about taking animals to bed. There is also implied group sex when the love quadrangle of Helena (Calista Flockhart), Hermia (Anna Friel), Lysander (Dominic West) and Demetrius (Christian Bale), all have a mud fight\bath before waking up stripped naked (by the fairies) and in each others arms. No one has a knack for sex and comedy like Shakespeare. Of note is Michelle Pfeiffer, who is devastatingly beautiful as the fairy Queen. She has not exuded this much sensuality into a role since, Lady Hawk'. Kevin Klein makes a great Ass, and Rupert Everett flaunts his male form about no doubt to entice both sexes as Oberon the fairy King (pun intended). Calista Flockhart takes her Ally McBeal into Helena. This is Shakespeare and this is a love-story born from the heart of a warm midsummer's night. When you awake the next morning, you will wonder to yourself, was it all a wonderful dream or did you really have sex with an Ass.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com Never before have the great Bard's words sounded more clunky than here in Michael Hoffman's (One Fine Day) screen adaptation of Shakespeare's whimsical romance. What the Puck happened? You can't blame the story  it's a classic. But why does it take a full 60 minutes for Hoffman's script to really get moving? You can't blame the production crew (featuring Oscar winners for Howards End and The Age of Innocence)  they create a wonderfully lush dream world. But its leafy green paradise is almost obscured by a bigger, brighter, olive-hued disaster. That's right  I'm talking about Calista Flockhart's teeth, and the way she shrieks each line sort of makes you want to jam your finger down her throat, too. Love may make fools of us all, but Ally McAnnoying sets a whole new standard.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"There was a time when seeing a particular Shakespeare play might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. People would rarely have a chance to see two different companies performing the same play. Then it was sufficient to be simply providing Shakespeare. That is not so any more. Turner Classic Movies frequently plays the 1935 film version. It is not so long since PBS broadcast a BBC version. In fact, the Internet Movie Database lists nine TV versions and it does not list the comic version featuring the Flying Karamazov Brothers. If a filmmaker wants to do a new version of a Shakespeare play, it should be at least in some way very original. It should have something that the previous versions do not offer. Certainly two films that I thought did that were Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and Ian McKellan's RICHARD III. The former managed to use diction that made following the dialog easy and a pleasure to follow. That and its pleasant Tuscan setting made the film a real joy. And McKellan's reframing of RICHARD III as an alternate history with a Fascist takeover of Britain in the 1930s stands as the single most exciting and inventive performance of Shakespeare I have ever seen. The new WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM was presenting a very familiar story, so with a fixed plot it should have been greatly creative in some other way. It should have been as innovative as those films. It was not. Michael Hoffman adapted the Shakespeare play and directed. Hoffman did a beautiful job creating a sumptuous look and feel for the 1995 film RESTORATION, but his ideas were far less rich or original for WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. As the film starts we are immediately plunged into cliche with Felix Mendelssohn's ""Midsummer Night's Dream."" It is a rather obvious choice and hardly one that is inspiring. The first original touch is to move the setting from ancient Athens to late 19th Century Monte Athene in Tuscany. But there is something of a problem there almost immediately. The play has many references to its setting, and there is an immediate dissonance to see Italy and hear it called Athens. It is also jarring to have characters whose names are Theseus, Demetrius, Lysander, Helena, and Hermia. The move of location is probably an attempt to repeat the effect that Branagh achieved with his Tuscan setting, but it really does not work the same sort of magic. For those who do not know the story, I will say just briefly that Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) is preparing to wed Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau) when he is asked to settle a dispute between a father and daughter. Egeus (Bernard Hill, recently seen as the captain going down with the ship in TITANIC) has arranged a marriage for his daughter Hermia (Anna Friel) to Demetrius (Christian Bale). But the rebellious daughter instead loves Lysander (Dominic West). Another woman, Helena (Calista Flockhart), loves Demetrius. Getting involved into the action is also a traveling theater company preparing to put on a bad play about Pyramus (Bottom (Kevin Kline)). And as if that were not enough in another part of the forest is Oberon, King of Fairies (Rupert Everett) is having his problems with his queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer). The stars of the film are really Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline. Kline has a somewhat expanded role from the Shakespeare involving Bottom's wife who never appeared in the original play. These sequences have to be done without dialog since it is easier to do it that way than to get Shakespeare back to write lines for their interaction. Stanley Tucci is almost always a pleasure to watch on the screen. Here he does his rubber-faced thing a little too much and amazingly he overstays his welcome. But Calista Flockhart (TV's Ally McBeal) manages to out-rubber-face even Tucci and to almost achieve the level of a Macaulay Culkin (not appearing in this film, thankfully). Sadly, the film is never as enchanting as it is supposed to be or even as it needs to be. Many of the intended magical elements turn leaden. Having Puck ride a bicycle again and again is just not all that whimsical. Having him ride a silly-looking plastic turtle intended to be real is even less so. Hoffman even has a mud-wrestling scene with Helena and Hermia. Really. The sequence of the play of ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" may be where some of the humor works the best in a sort of imitation Monty Python way. Still, this sequence comes off as gratuitous filler, but then it always did in the original play also, so that is not Hoffman's fault. Once one accepts the Italian setting, the use of Italian opera melodies is pleasant and does add to the mood, though when the same melodies are repeated one starts to wonder if there were not more to choose from. In spite of the cast, this is a competent but unexceptional version of one of Shakespeare's more popular plays. I rate it 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.

"Midsummer Night's Dream, A",Comedy,2020,"Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D. Fox Searchlight Pictures/ Regency Enterprises Director: Michael Hoffman Writer: Michael Hoffman Cast: Christian Bale, Rupert Everett, Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Sophie Marceau, Michelle Pfeiffer, David Strathairn, Stanley Tucci As the song goes, ""When I'm not near/ The girl I love/ I love the girl I'm near."" Love is so wonderfully irrational. Who but an accountant would have it any other way? Shakespeare took advantage of love's illogical, nay demented, nature, in fashioning a fable that--take away the sylvan background and the eye-popping changes wrought by extra-natural elements--could take place right in the heart of Times Square on New Year's Eve. Shakespeare, known for his unusually perceptive insights into human nature as well as his impossibly lyrical utterances, knew that reason and love do not often keep good company. And so he had no problem arranging for a beautiful fairy queen to fall hopelessly in love with an ass. Next time you see a strange-looking couple on the street and wonder, ""What could she possibly see in him?"" remember that the most ravishing femme fatale just might find a guy with donkey ears and an eccentric nature more exciting than an army of bean counters hunched over their desks at Broderick & Company CPA PC. In keeping with the festive mood of Midsummer Night which is celebrated in England on June 23, Shakespeare offers not one story of a pair of star-crossed lovers as he did with ""Romeo and Juliet"" but looks into comic possibilities of a similar situation involving five sets of ill-sorted lovers. The very multiplicity gives the play comic overtones. ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" opens during the four seemingly endless days before Theseus, Duke of Athens, would wed Hippolyta (whom he won in battle). She is not so eager. Demetrius and Lysander love Hermia. Helena, who loves Demetrius, is lusted after by no one. Oberon and Titania, the fairy king and queen, have separated. In a play-within-the- play, Pyramus and Thisbe are divided by the mutual dislike of their parents. Despite the seemingly insurmountable difficulties that love brings to us all, Shakespeare is determined to show that everything gets sorted out. Love works. Love can put an ass's head on anyone. Has this, dear reader, ever happened to you? As for logic, well, ""Midsummer"" sets before us people who are equals in class and wealth, its men and women about equal in height. What makes one man fall in love with one woman, ignoring all others? The action unfolds at night, when reason gives way to dreams, and by daybreak we will see how ""the lunatic, the lover and the poet/ Are of imagination all compact."" Shakespeare is coy about giving specific instructions and set designs to the people who are to direct his works, leaving (in this case) Michael Hoffman to tinker as he will with the natural background, the order and length of the scenes, even the century. He chooses to update ""Midsummer"" from 16th Century Athens to the Tuscany region of Italy in the late 19th Century, when bicycles were first coming into their own as a new invention. For his score, he freely employs operatic sections from Bellini's ""Norman,"" from Verdi's ""La Traviata,"" and the traditional background music of Mendelssohn--as well as a brand-new orchestration from Simon Boswell. The lush film--the most expensive work to date by Fox Searchlight Pictures--opens as Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) prepares for his wedding to the reluctant Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau). During the days prior to the nuptials, the Duke holds court listening to a complaint from the starchy old Egeus (Bernard Hill). Egeus, for reason wholly arbitrary, insists that his daughter Hermia (Anna Friel) marry Demetrius (Christian Bale) rather than the dashing Lysander (Dominic West) whom she loves. The lovers plan to elope into the woods using their newly-invented bicycles. Meanwhile the lovelorn Helena (Calistra Flockhart) follows the man of her dreams, Demetrius, like a spaniel, masochistically insisting that the more he scorns her, the more she will love him. At the same time a group of amateur actors head for the woods looking for a space to rehearse the play ""The Most Lamentable Comedy, the Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe,"" under the direction of the Peter Quince (played by an almost unrecognizable Roger Rees). As all converge, they are watched by the woodland fairies, particularly the mischievous Robin Goodfellow, or Puck (Stanley Tucci), the fairy king, Oberon (Rupert Everett), and his estranged queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer). Puck sprinkles drops from a flower into the eyes of some of the sleeping mortals and the slumbering fairy queen, causing each to fall in love with the first person he or she sees upon awakening. The mixup that results is the source of most of the comedy. For reasons known principally to the adapter-director, Michael Hoffman, the company of thesps is a mixed one. British, American and French performers get together leaving the audience to judge which nationality can do the Shakespeare best. Surprisingly the Americans outdo the British in most junctures, the one major exception being the American David Strathairn, so adept in quirky roles such as those directed by John Sayles (""The Return of the Secaucus Seven""). Here he is overly stiff appearing uncomfortable as though intimidated open himself for judgment ""as a Shakespearean actor."" Nor does Michele Pfeiffer, for all her beauty, look alive in the role of the fairy queen or exhibit the slightest chemistry with Rupert Everett. Kevin Kline runs away with the show (surprise!) as Bottom the Weaver, who is transformed into an ass (see above note about how most of us lovers are likewise converted). Capturing the screen as an obvious ham, he debates his role as Pyramus with the theater company's manager so vivaciously that we wonder whether Mr. Hoffman was spared similar domination. He clowns furiously when afforded his donkey's ears and yet at key points allows us to look into the pathos that has enveloped the man who has been so changed by love. Stanley Tucci, known by lovers of art movies for his hilarious job as a nervous chef in the wonderful ""The Big Night"" easily becomes the movie's center, its impresario, as he sprinkles love's potion indiscriminately and then sits back with a smirk on his face to judge humankind: ""Lord, what fools these mortals be!"" Oliver Stapleton's camera conveys the mysterious sylvan atmosphere of the woods, though he could have done more with the Tuscan town that forms the urban backdrop of the story. When you consider that the only special effects employed by Hoffman are the donkey's ears set upon Kevin Kline, you may agree that this interpretation of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" surprisingly only the second major studio presentation of the great comedy (the first being the Warner Bros. 1935 version with James Cagney, Dick Powell, Olivia de Havilland and Joe E. Brown), is a vivid one indeed. What you come away with is a graphic illustration of the lunacy of lovers and yet another production that has us thinking about the nature of illusion and reality. Were the proceedings of the humans and fairies in the forest an actual occurrence or simply the lovers' dream? Was Bottom really converted into an ass, or did he simply dream about his own subconscious view of himself as, at base, a donkey? We sit in our seats in the darkened theater, knowing full well that everything on the screen really happened. Or did it? As Prospero will say later on in ""The Tempest,"" ""We are such stuff/ As dreams are made on, and our little life/ Is rounded with a sleep."" Despite the inadequacy of a handful of actors in this ""Midsummer,"" the movie comes awfully close to being a dream production.

"Client, The",Documentary,2019,"Starring: Susan Sarandon, Brad Renfro, Tommy Lee Jones, Mary-Louise Parker, Anthony LaPaglia, J. T. Walsh, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis Director: Joel Schumacher Producers: Arnon Milchan and Steven Reuther Screenplay: Akiva Goldsman and Robert Getchell based on the novel by John Grisham Cinematography: Tony Pierce-Roberts Music: Howard Shore Released by Warner Brothers This time around, I thought I'd do things a little differently. For both THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF, I made my way through the written version before approaching the cinematic one. Neither book dazzled me, and the impressions given by the movies were less memorable. So, for THE CLIENT, I decided to eschew Grisham's novel altogether and see if, divorced from its source material, Joel Schumacher's film could provide a couple hours of light entertainment. Besides, a friend of mine was only able to get through a third of book, and her opinion of Grisham is certainly higher than mine. It's not difficult to understand why THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF, and THE CLIENT have all been bestsellers. They're tightly-written, don't require a lot of concentration, have very simple storylines, and can be read in a sitting or two. In essence, they're what someone I know calls ""good trash."" Grisham is prolific--and now, very wealthy. Unfortunately, his writing makes for a perfect Hollywood screenplay--lots of action and not much originality. THE CLIENT's greatest disadvantage is its flat plot, which includes few (if any) surprises and revolves on a premise that we've seen before--in THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF, among others. Grisham apparently has a thing about a group of law officers going after some innocent victim of circumstances. THE CLIENT's premise is tenuous in its believability. The movie starts out with young Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) out in the woods, watching a mob lawyer try to kill himself. In attempting to foil the suicide, Mark gets caught, and has to listen to a rambling confession before the lawyer blows his brains out. After that, hotshot prosecutor Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) wants Mark on the witness stand, thinking--correctly--that the boy learned the location of the missing corpse of a dead senator. Realizing that he's in over his head, Mark seeks out an attorney, and finds one in the person of Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), who takes his case for a fee of one dollar. But a killer (Anthony LaPaglia) who believes Mark knows too much, is after the boy and anyone to whom he might tell his secret. In the beginning, Mark won't reveal anything about his conversation with the dead mob lawyer. Why? Later, after his life has been threatened, the reason is obvious, but why hide things at the start? I guess we're supposed to believe that the kid is scared and confused, but he does enough clear-headed things to limit the plausibility of this explanation. Despite plot holes and contrivances, THE CLIENT is a well-made motion picture. Everything about it (except the screenplay) is top-notch. Director Joel Schumacher (whose last film was FALLING DOWN) has spun a web of intrigue by getting the most out of his cast and crew. With expert jobs done by the editor and cinematographer, THE CLIENT moves while having its share of dark, brooding moments as well as tautly suspenseful ones. The cast is impeccable. Newcomer Brad Renfro portrays Mark with a palpable mix of anger and fear. Susan Sarandon gives her usual solid performance, and Tommy Lee Jones oozes equal parts charisma and false charm. Mary-Louise Parker, one of the better representatives of today's crop of twentysomething actors, is underused as Mark's mother Dianne, but she makes the most of every scene she's in. THE CLIENT is an example of what happens when a production team does the best they can possibly do with a routine script. Schumacher has succeeded where two other accomplished directors (Sydney Pollack, who did THE FIRM, and Alan Pakula, of THE PELICAN BRIEF) have failed: bringing a Grisham novel to the screen in a manner that's more entertaining than trying. This isn't a masterpiece of suspense, but it has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer entertainment. I think from now on, I'll skip reading Grisham's books and wait for the movies. If nothing else, it will save me some time. - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).

"Client, The",Documentary,2019,"The third, and by far the most successful translation of a John Grisham legal suspense novel to film. A tough little trailer park pre-teen named Mark Sway (Brad Refro) happens upon the suicide of a mafia attorney and is almost instantly caught between mob hitmen and a remorseless federal prosecutor (Tommy Lee Jones). Mark shrewdly hires himself a lawyer--and is lucky enough to get Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), a woman who has lost so much by surrender that she is now willing to risk everything to win big. The story is at bottom just as hokey and nearly as piously legalistic as THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF, but director Joel Schumacher cannily finds the best in it. He finesses the violence, putting all of it off camera, and concentrates instead on character and relationships, specifically the one between Mark and his damaged but utterly determined lawyer Reggie--a part that Sarandon seizes with joyful abandon. The film, particularly the first two-thirds, is filled with wonderful setpieces: the opening confrontation with the fat, suicidal lawyer (Walter Olkewicz) in his car; Mark's visit to a decrepit roach motel of an office building, full of shady shysters; almost every scene with Jones as U.S attorney ""Reverend"" Roy Foltrigg directing his supporting crew of worried yes-men; and every confrontation between Sarandon and Jones. (Jones essentially clones his character from ""The Fugitive""--and is every bit as much fun to watch as he was in that film.) The director and screenwriters (Akiva Goldsman and Robert Getchell) eventually get into trouble following the novel too faithfully. All those threats and atmospherics eventually have to pay off in some kind of action scenes--and Grisham's books seem to have the least resourceful assassins in the genre. The letdown, however, is almost welcome. In what must be the most over-pyroed, over-stunted year in the history of the medium, Schumacher sticks with people instead of falls and explosions, and makes it work.

"Client, The",Documentary,2019,"THE CLIENT is the fourth of John Grisham's five novels. I read the first four on vacation in Hawaii last year. I saw THE FIRM, awarded it ** 1/2, and gave it a mild thumbs up. I avoided THE PELICAN BRIEF because it got such awful reviews. They have not made movies of the first or fifth books yet. I found that liked the movie, THE CLIENT, for some excellent acting and for the great Grisham plot. Repeating his THE FUGITIVE type of role, Tommy Lee Jones plays the quintessential prosecutor who would do anything to get the bad guys in jail. Here Jones plays a U.S. Attorney who wants his next job to be that of Governor of Louisiana, hence he wants good press coverage. A young boy (Brad Renfro) may have overheard some information that Jones and the mob both want. He hires a tough but very inexperienced lawyer played by Susan Sarandon to defend his rights and to protect him from both sides. This is the basic plot set up. There are a lot of twists and turns after that - some predictable, some not. Almost every word Jones utters is terrific. The script is good, but his delivery is what makes it. I love the way he delivers the lines: ""I want that boy in court, manana! You hear what I'm say'n?"" Almost as good is Sarandon. She plays a complex character that is both tough and vulnerable. Renfro plays the archetypal burnt out teenager. His performance was acceptable at best. I think they should have got a stronger actor or at least the director, Joel Schumacher, should have given him more guidance. Renfro was not convincing enough for me. Then again, maybe it was the way Grisham wrote the character that I have problems with. There were numerous minor characters of merit. The judge (Ossie Davis) was the best of the small performances. THE CLIENT runs 1:57. It is correctly rated PG-13 for a little violence and a modest amount of profanity. (It would be XXX rated for smoking. Almost everyone smoked, and they smoked a lot. Cigarettes were even used in evidence. NONE of the smoking was necessary.) I think kids over 12 will enjoy the show. I recommend it and award it ***.

"Client, The",Documentary,2019,"Before I saw THE CLIENT I had already been disenchanted by the books of John Grisham. To be quite frank, I haven't read them (although they used to be something resembling bestsellers on the small and bibliophobic market of my country) but I had opportunity to watch two of the screen adaptations - Pollack's THE FIRM and Pakula's PELICAN BRIEF - and that was enough to make me think about Grisham as nothing more as mediocre author. By that time, I had already watched enough of Joel Schumacher's films to have opinion about him as nothing more than mediocre film-maker. Perhaps that was the reason why this film actually worked - mediocre script was perfect match for mediocre talent. The movie, like almost all Grisham's books is set in American South and features some unusual characters in big, and, more often than not, legal trouble. This time the protagonist in question is Mark Sway (played by Brad Renfro), 11-year old boy from dysfunctional family who had just witnessed the suicide of a important mob lawyer Romey Clifford (Walter Olkewicz). Just before killing himself, Romey told Mark about the body of a murdered senator and other details that would put away wiseguys like his client Barry Muldano (Anthony La Paglia) behind the bars. Federal prosecutors led by politically ambitious Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) are convinced that the boy knows those details and they begin harassing him. The boy then hires attorney in a form of Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). She, being the recovered alcoholic, perhaps doesn't look like a much of help, but she would fight for the rights of his client. In the meatime, Muldano and his cronies are trying to kill the boy. The film has rather weak premise - boy is smart enough to elude law enforcement and hire attorneys, yet not intelligent enough to know that the co-operation with the authorities is the only way for him to stay alive. Perhaps that works in real world, but in Grisham's works, same as in the script by Akiva Goldsman, there are some other rules. In any case, Schumacher directs this forgettable script as real professional, not allowing us to stop and think of all the flaws in it. The biggest attraction here is a great acting talent, most notable in the forms of Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones, actors whose talent is very suitable for fascinating Grisham's characters. Sarandon is very good as strong professional woman, and Jones is great as scruples yet charming public official. Actors in minor roles are also good, like Ossie Davis as sympathetic judge, Will Patton as menacing yet intelligent policeman and Mary Louise Parker as boy's desperate mother. On the other hand, Anthony La Paglia is rather pathetic in thankless role of stupid Mafioso. All in all, THE CLIENT is still forgettable, but watchable piece of cinema that gives the phrase ""mediocrity"" a good name.

"Client, The",Documentary,2019,"Starring: Susan Sarandon, Brad Renfro, Tommy Lee Jones, Anthony LaPaglia, Mary-Louise Parker. Screenplay: Akiva Goldsman and Robert Getchell. Director: Joel Schumacher. The film adaptation of John Grisham's THE CLIENT is in a unique position. Commercially, there are probably great expectations; THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF combined to gross over $200 million at the box office last year. Artistically, on the other hand, the expectations are probably much lower, again based on the previous Grisham adaptations. Grisham on the screen is like Grisham on the page: glossy, undemanding, straight-ahead potboilers, perfect for mass consumption. But surprisingly, THE CLIENT is slightly more than that. Even if the whole does not quite equal the sum of its more impressive parts, THE CLIENT edges out THE FIRM as the best of the three Grisham films. THE CLIENT is the story of eleven-year-old Mark Sway (Brad Renfro), a poor Tennessee youth who is in the wrong place at the wrong time one day. While out in the woods with his younger brother, Mark stumbles upon a suicidal Mafia lawyer, who spills some dark secrets to Mark before he kills himself. The incident leaves the younger brother traumatized into a catatonic state, and leaves Mark as the only witness. This makes him valuable to publicity-hungry New Orleans district attorney Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones), and dangerous to Barry ""The Blade"" Moldano (Anthony LaPaglia), who stands to lose the most from Mark's knowledge. Convinced he needs help, Mark turns to Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), a lawyer looking for a second chance, and who becomes Mark's only hope. THE CLIENT, like THE FIRM, benefits most from a wealth of solid performances. Susan Sarandon carries herself with the tension of someone who knows she has made a lot of mistakes and can't afford to make any more; Tommy Lee Jones does an oilier take on his Sam Gerard from THE FUGITIVE, with a dash more Southern bluster. The scenes in which Sarandon and Jones tangle are masterful, sparks of raw intelligence flying between the two gifted performers, making it regrettable that there aren't more. Newcomer Brad Renfro actually has far more screen time than either of his big-name co-stars, and he is occasionally very good, particularly when showing a bit of an edge. He's less successful when asked to deliver emotion-filled speeches, like his description of the custody battle between his parents. The best performance, however, might be that of Mary- Louise Parker as Mark's mother. In many ways it is a better written part than any of the three leads, rich and complex, and Parker is wonderful in a scene-stealing supporting role similar to Holly Hunter and David Strathairn in THE FIRM. There is so much good acting going on in THE CLIENT (aside from Anthony LaPaglia, whose cartoonish Mafioso does everything but grab his crotch) that it's easy to overlook what a hum-drum thriller it is. This isn't true of the first half hour, where director Joel Schumacher keeps the tension notched up high. The encounter between Mark and the babbling attorney, intercut with the reactions of the ever more frightened brother, is extremely effective, and the low-angle perspective on Mark's confrontation with an obnoxious police officer creates a heightened paranoia. Then, as Grisham plots tend to do, THE CLIENT's sputters out like a released balloon. The climactic showdown is abrupt, silly and very unsatisfying, an appropriate wrap-up to a sluggish second hour. It almost seems as though Schumacher realized that the suspense elements were the least interesting, and did only what was necessary for resolution. In fact, THE CLIENT is much more effective as a character study than it is as a thriller. The relationship between Mark and Reggie is intriguing, as Mark realizes he needs to trust someone and Reggie tries to exorcise the demons of an alcoholism which drove away her children. But that relationship is a bit rushed, and while both THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF overstayed their welcome, THE CLIENT might have benefited from an additional ten or fifteen minutes of character development. It might have made the maudlin closing scene between Reggie and Mark more tolerable. Still, THE CLIENT's first- rate cast carries it through its many lulls. Provided you aren't heading to see THE CLIENT expecting a pulse-pounding thriller, its possible you could be in for a pleasant surprise.

"Client, The",Documentary,2019,"Directed by Joel Schumacher Written by Akiva Goldsman, Robert Getchell, based on the novel by John Grisham Cast Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee-Jones, Mary Louise-Parker, Anthony LaPaglia, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, Brad Renfro, and J.T. Walsh MPAA Rating ""PG-13"" Running Time 120 minutes THE FIRM was soft, THE PELICAN BRIEF wasn't, and THE CLIENT is a trial. Why is John Grisham so hard to make into a movie? Three, count 'em three different filmmakers have attempted to best the bestselling author and, with the lastest loss THE CLIENT, three strikes have made little more than one out. The story is straight-forward and easy-to-follow and doesn't have one scene of anyone going crazy in a copy room. The plot is about a eleven-year old Tennessee boy (Renfro) who may be the key to a Memphis mob murder. He won't talk to the Feds and barely cooperates with his lawyer (Sarandon). That is, until the mob sends some men to ""tie up loose ends."" Even though no one actually says that in the movie. Brad Renfro and Susan Sarandon are the stars and they have good chemistry and are more believable than either Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts. Renfro, in particular, is politely unpolished and a refreshing change for smoother child actors. With the exception of Ossie Davis--who chairs the film's sole exciting scene--the rest of the cast is a waste. Yes, even Tommy Lee Jones. But they all do drawl within the lines; sometimes even sounding like bad Elvis impersonators. Speaking of which, I counted a total of eight references to The Big E. There may be more. Uuuh-huh. THE CLIENT has some good local color and the occasional flash of humor, but, considering the competition, is hardly deserving of your summer movie dollars. There's nothing exciting here. Anyone up to again adapt Clive Cussler? Surely no one remembers RAISE THE TITANIC.... BOTTOM LINE: This is the guy who's going to direct BATMAN FOREVER??
